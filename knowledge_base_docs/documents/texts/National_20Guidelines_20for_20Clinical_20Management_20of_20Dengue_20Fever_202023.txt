INTRODUCTION  
Dengue is the most rapidly spreading mosquito borne viral disease of mankind, with a 30 - 
fold increase  in global  incidence  over the last five decades.  It is a major  public  health  concern  
throughout  tropical  and subtropical  regions  of the world.  Almost  half of the world’s  population  
lives in countries  where  dengue  is endemic.  Dengue  has been identified  as one of the 17 
neglected tropical diseases by World Health Organization (WHO) as mentioned in their first  
report  on neglected  tropical  diseases  (2010).  Although  the full global  burden  of the disease  is 
still uncertain,  the patterns  are alarming  for both human  health  and the economy.  Every  year 
thousands  of severe  cases  of dengue  arise.  It includes  20000  deaths;  264 disability -adjusted  
life years (DALY)  per million  populations  per year are lost. The case-fatality  rate for dengue  
fever varies  by country  and most fatal cases  are among  children  and young  adults.  
 
1.1 Global  Scenario  
Before 1970, only 9 countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics. The disease is 
now endemic  in more than 128 countries  in the WHO regions  of Africa,  America,  the 
Eastern  Mediterranean, South -East Asia and the Western Pacific. America, South -East Asia  
and Western  Pacific  regions  are the most seriously  affected.  
 
According  to WHO,  a vast majority  of cases  are asymptomatic  and hence  the actual  
numbers  of dengue  cases  are under  reported  and many  cases  are misclassified.  One 
estimate  indicates  390 million  dengue  infections  per year (95%  credible  interval  284–528 
million),  of which  96 million (67 –136 million) manifest clinically (with any severity of 
disease). Another study, of  the prevalence of dengue, estimates that 3.9 billion people, in 
128 countries, ar e at risk of  infection with dengue viruses.  Although the full global burden 
of the disease is uncertain,  the initiation  of activities  to record  all dengue  cases,  partly  
explains  the sharp  increase  in the number  of cases  reported  in recent  years.  The number  
of cases  reported  increased  from 2.4 million  in 2010 to 5.2 million  in 2019.  The maximum  
number  of dengue  cases  reported  globally  was in 2019.Approximately  1.8 billion  (more  
than 70%)  population  who is at risk for dengue  worldwide, lives in SEAR and WPR, which 
contributes to nearly 75% of the current global disease  burden  due to dengue.  All Member  
States  in the SEARO  Region  except  the Democratic  People’s Republic of Korea being 
endemic to dengue. The Region contributes to more than  half of the global  burden  of 
dengue.  Five countries  (India,  Indonesia,  Myanmar,  Sri Lanka  and Thailand)  are among  
the 30 most highly  endemic  countries  in the world.  In SEAR countries,  number  of dengue  
cases  increased  over 3 fold over the last decade,  from 0.19 million  cases  in 2011 to over 
0.45 million  cases  in 2015 and 0.68 million  cases  in 2019.  Deaths  have increased  from 
1050 in 2011 to 1684 in 2019. In 2020, the number of dengue cases and deaths in seven Chapter  1 

2  SEAR member  states  dropped  to 0.26 million  and 928, respectively  (Source:  WHO).  
 
1.2 National  Scenario  
Dengue  virus was isolated  in India during  1945 
for the first time. The first evidence  of 
occurrence  of dengue  fever in the country  was 
reported  during  1956 from Vellore  district  in 
Tamil  Nadu.  The first dengue  fever outbreak  
occurred  in Calcutta  (West  Bengal) in 1963. In 
India, till date, all States/UTs, (except Ladakh) 
have reported dengue cases during  the last two 
decades  (even  Lakshadweep  has been 
reporting suspected dengue cases). The states  
that have reported  dengue fever since 1991 are 
shown in Figure  1. 
Figure  1: Areas  reported  Dengue  cases  since  1991 
During 1996, one of the most severe outbreaks of dengue fever occurred in Delhi, with 
10252 cases and 423 deaths being reported (country total being 16517 cases and 545 
deaths).  
 
In 2006, the country witnessed an outbreak of dengue fever with 12317 cases and 184 
deaths. The incidence of dengue has been found to be increasing from past few years. 
During 2018, a total of 1,24,493 cases were reported; 2,05,243 in 201 9; 44,585 in 2020; 
1,93,752 in 2021 and 2,33,251 in 2022. The case fatality rate (CFR - deaths per 100 cases) 
has declined from 3.3% in 1996 to 0.3% in 2014 and sustained at 0.2% in 2015 to 2018, 
and 0.1% in 2019, which has been maintained at this level sin ce then. (Source: NCVBDC)  
 
Every year during the period of July -Nov, an upsurge in the cases of dengue has been 
observed. The disease has a seasonal pattern i.e., the cases peak after monsoon and it is 
not uniformly distributed throughout the year. However , the states in southern and 
western parts of the country report perennial transmission. The seasonal trends for 2018 -
2022 are given in Figure 2:  
 
Figure  2: Seasonal  trend  of Dengue  Cases  in India  2018 -2022  


3  Ae. aegypti breeding was more common in urban areas and as such the disease was observed  
to be mostly  prevalent  in urban  areas.  However,  the trend is now changing  due to socio- 
economic and man -made ecological changes that have resulted in invasion of Ae. aegypti  
mosquitoes into the rural areas, which has significantly contributed for rural invasion of the  
disease.

EPIDEMIOLOGY  
Dengue ranks as the most important, rapidly emerging mosquito -borne viral disease in  
recent  years and is endemic  in all continents.  It has shown  uprise  due to various  reasons  viz., 
construction activities, life -style changes and deficient water management, improper water  
storage,  stagnation  of rain water  in containers  lying outside  houses  and poor water  storage  
practices  leading  to proliferation  of vector  breeding  sites in urban,  peri-urban  and rural areas.  
The Epidemiology of dengue is an intricate phenomenon which depends upon a complex  
relationship between epidemiological factors viz., host (man and mosquito), agent (virus)  
and the environment (abiotic and biotic factors). The complexity of re lationship among  
these factors  eventually  determines  the level of endemicity  in an area. During  inter-epidemic  
period, the transmission of Dengue remains low due to extremes of temperature with low  
relative humidity but during monsoon the environment becomes suitable for vectors,  
temperature between 25oC ±5oC and relative humidity around 80% and innumerable 
small water  collections  result  in high vector  density.  
 
 
 2.1 Dengue  virus 
The agent i.e. dengue virus, is categorized under the genus  
Flavivirus. The virus contains single stranded RNA and is  
small in size (50nm)  (Figure  3). There  are four dengue  virus 
serotypes  which  are designated  as DENV -1, DENV -2, DENV - 
3 and DENV -4. These serotypes may be in circulation either  
singly or more than one can be in circulation in any area at  
the same time. Although all four serotypes are antigenically  
similar,  still they are different  enough  to elicit cross-protection   
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3: Dengue virus  
under  electron  microscope  
only for a few months  after infection  by any one of them.  Infection  with one serotype  confers  
lifelong  immunity  to that virus serotype  only. 
 
 2.2 Molecular  epidemiology  
The four dengue  virus types (DENV1 -4) called  as dengue  virus serotypes  form a phylogenetic  
group and differ in nucleotide sequence from each other. These are closely related to one  
another than to other flaviviruses and form an antigenic complex of their own. Within each  
serotype, subtypes or genotypes are detected based on their ph ylogenetic analysis of the  
genomic  region  in the envelope  gene.  Chapter  2 


5  • DENV -1: Three 
• DENV -2: Six 
• DENV -3: Four 
• DENV -4: Four 
 
The four dengue  virus serotypes  can co-circulate  in the endemic  areas because  the immunity  
to one serotype  does not protect  from the infection  by a heterotopic  serotype.  Individual  
variation occurs in antibody responses to dengue virus. The secondary infections are  
associated with elevated risks of severe disease outcomes. However, the primary and  
secondary  infections  are distinguishable  based  on their antibody  responses.  The ability  of all 
DENV  serotypes  to utilise  pre-existing  heterotypic  flavivirus  antibody  to enhance  infection  is 
a unique  feature  of dengue  which  distinguishes  it from all other flavi virus and is considered  
to be the primary  basis of pathogenesis.  All four serotypes  are isolated  from India.  
 
The dengue virus genome is composed of three structural protein genes encoding the  
nucleocapsid of  core protein  (C), a membrane  associated  protein  (M), an envelope  protein  
(E) and seven non -structural (NS) proteins - NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5.  
The functions  of all the individual  NS-proteins  are not well characterized.  However,  NS1 
protein  has been shown  to interact  with the host immune  system,  and known  to evoke  T-cell 
responses. In dengue virus infection, patients have measurable levels of NS1 protein in the  
blood,  which  is utilized  as a diagnostic  marker  of the infection.  
 
Most of the time, dengue  viral infection  is asymptomatic  and exact cause  of severity  among  
some  patients  is still not clearly  understood  when  there is interaction  between  agent  and 
host. Infected  people  play a major  role in spreading  dengue  virus by their movement  to newer  
areas.  
 
 2.3 Vector  
Dengue  viruses  are transmitted  from infected  person  to others  by the bite of female  Aedes  
(Ae) mosquitoes.  In India,  Aedes  aegypti  is the main vector  in most urban  areas;  however,  Ae. 
albopictus  is also incriminated  in many states.  But other species  like Ae. polynesiensis  and Ae. 
niveus  have also been incriminated  as secondary  vectors  in some countries.  
 
Female Aedes mosquito deposits eggs singly on damp surfaces just above the water line.  
Under  optimal  conditions,  the adult is emerged  in seven  days (after  the aquatic  stages  in the 
life cycle of Ae. aegypti ). At low temperature, it may take several weeks to emerge. However,  
the eggs can withstand  desiccation  for more than a year (can remain  in viable  dry condition)  
and emerge  within  24 hours  once it comes  in contact  with water,  which  is also a major  hurdle  
in prevention  and control  of dengue.  
 
The climatic conditions particularly temperature and rainfall play key role on the life cycle,  
breeding and longevity of vectors and thus transmission of the disease. Average survival of  
Ae. aegypti  is 30 days and Ae. albopictus  is about  eight weeks.  During  the rainy season,  when 
survival  is longer,  the risk of virus transmission  is greater.  Aedes  is a day time feeder  and can fly 

6  up to a limited  distance  of 400 meters.  In absence  of any vaccine  or specific  drug for dengue,  
vector  control  proved  to be very significant  in preventing  disease  transmission.  
 
Ae. aegypti breeds almost entirely in domestic man -made water receptacles found in and  
around  households,  water  storage  containers,  water  reservoir,  overhead  tanks,  desert  coolers,  
unused  tiers, coconut  shells,  disposable  cups, unused  grinding  stone,  industrial  and domestic  
junk, construction  sites, etc. Ae. albopictus  prefers  natural  larval habitats  which  include  tree 
holes, latex collecting cups in rubber plantation, leaf axils, bamboo stumps, coconut shells,  
etc. However,  Ae. albopictus  breeding  has been reported  recently  in domestic  habitats  as well. 
 
 2.4 Environmental  Factors  
The population  of Ae. aegypti  fluctuates  with rain fall and water  storage.  Its life span is 
influenced  by temperature  and humidity,  survives  best between  16o-30oC and a relative  
humidity  of 60- 80%. Ae. aegypti  is highly  anthropophilic  and rests in cool shady  places.  The 
rural spread  of Ae. aegypti  is a relatively  recent  occurrence  associated  with the societal  and 
life style changes  in rural areas coupled with developmental activities, improved transport 
systems etc. Ae. albopictus , has posed  serious  threats  of dengue  transmission  in certain  
geographical  regions  endowed with sylvatic environment particularly in peninsular and 
North Eastern states.  Climatic conditions and global warming are also influencing on the 
geographical spread of  Aedes  and dengue  into newer  areas.  
 
 2.5 Host Factor  
Dengue  virus infects humans and several species of lower primates. People of all ages and  
both genders are at risk. Secondary dengue infection is a risk factor for developing severe  
form of illness including passively acquired antibodies in infants. Travel to De ngue endemic  
area is most important risk factor. If the patient develops fever more than two weeks after  
travel,  Dengue  infection  is unlikely  to occur due to travel.  Migration  of patient  during  viraemia  
to a non -endemic area may introduce it into that area . The geographical spread of dengue  
has been reported to be occurring mainly by the travelling of people from endemic area to  
non-endemic  areas.  
 
 2.6 Transmission  Cycle  
The Ae. aegypti  usually  becomes  infected  with dengue  virus when it takes blood  meal from a 
person  during  the acute  febrile  (viraemia)  phase  of Dengue  illness.  After an extrinsic  incubation  
period  of 8 to 10 days, the mosquito  becomes  infected  and virus is transmitted  when  the 
infected  female  mosquito  bites and injects  its saliva  into the wound  of the person  and in this 
way, the cycle of dengue  continues.  Dengue  begins  abruptly  after an intrinsic  incubation  
period  of 4 to 7 days (range  3-14 days).  There  is also evidence  that vertical  transmission  of 
Dengue  virus from infected  female  mosquitoes  to the next generation.  

7  Though  primarily  transmission  occurs  through  the bite of vector,  there are reports  of dengue  
transmission  through  blood  transfusion  and organ  transplantation.  There  are also reports  
of congenital dengue infections occurred in neonates born to mothers infected very late in  
pregnancy.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY  
OF DENGUE  FEVER  
The exact pathophysiology  of dengue  virus infection  leading  to various  disease  manifestations  
is incompletely understood. The following stages characterize the course of illness; early 
infection, dissemination, immune response, and subsequent viral clearance. Host immune  
response plays an essentia l role in the pathogenesis of dengue fever. Various mechanisms  
are proposed to explain the signs and symptoms observed in a patient, and most have the  
following central themes:  
 
I. Antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE)  
II. Cytokine Storm  
III. Vasculopathy  
IV. Coagulopathy  
 
 3.1 Antibody -Dependent  Enhancement  (ADE)  
The dengue  virus is initially  taken  up by dendritic  cells. After antigen  processing,  it is presented  
to the T cells. Dengue  virus has three principal  proteins  targeted  by the host immune  
response;  envelop protein (E), precursor membrane (pre -M), and NS1. E protein -specific 
antibodies  cause neutralization of infection and block attachment to cell receptors. Pre -M–
specific antibodies  bind to partially  matured  virions  and show poor neutralization  of 
infection  but can mediate  ADE. NS1 is not found  in the virion;  NS1-specific  antibodies  are 
therefore  incapable  of neutralizing  the infection  but can direct  the complement -mediated  
lysis of infected  cells. 
 
As a result  of infection,  two types of antibodies  are produced:  neutralizing  and non-
neutralizing.  Neutralization  requires  a threshold  level of antibodies.  The neutralizing  
antibodies  can protect  against  a specific  serotype  of the virus.  The non-neutralizing  
antibodies  can bind but do not neutralize  an infecting  virus.  After forming  this virus-
antibody  complex,  it enters  the host cells, specifically dendritic cells and macrophages. 
Once inside the cell, the virus replicates and generates  high virus titers in the blood.  This 
phenomenon  is known  as Antibody -Dependent Enha ncement (ADE) of infection.  
 
 3.2 Cytokine  storm  
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, specific to the dengue virus, cause lysis of virus -infected cells and  
produce  cytokines  such as IFN-gamma,  Tumour  Necrosis  Factor  (TNF) -alpha,  and lymphotoxin.  Chapter  3 

9  These  cytokines  result  in a “cytokine  storm”  and ultimately  lead to severe  disease.  Moreover,  
IFN-gamma  also enhances  the expression  of immunoglobulin  receptors,  which  augments  the 
antibody -dependent  enhancement  of infection.  
 
Various  mechanisms  are proposed  to explain  the clinical  manifestations  and pathogenesis  of 
cytokine  storm.  
 
Mechanism  of cytokine  storm  
• Introduction  of dengue  virus in Macrophage/Monocyte/dendritic  cells. 
• Previous  infection  with heterologous  dengue  serotype  results  in the production  of non- 
protective  antiviral  antibodies  
• These  antibodies  help and bind to the virion’s  surface  Fc gamma  receptor  and attach  to 
the macrophages  and monocytes.  
• This lead to an amplified  response  of the immune  system  leading  to excess  and rapid 
release  of cytokines  (TNF alpha,  Interferon -gamma,  IL2, IL12, etc) 
• This amplified  response  leads to a cytokine  storm.  
 
Therefore, this disproportionally enhanced immune response, particularly in secondary  
heterologous infections, is responsible for various pathogenetic mechanisms such as  
vasculopathy,  coagulopathy,  and organ  involvement.  
 
Various chemokines and cytokines are produced, such as TNFα, IFNα, IFNγ, IL6, IL8, and IL -10. 
Some  complement  fragments  such as C3a and C5a also play a significant  role in vasculopathy,  
coagulopathy,  and bleeding.  
 
 3.3 Vasculopathy  in Dengue  
The clinical  presentation  of dengue  fever varies  widely.  While  most symptomatic  patients  
recover  after a short illness,  a small proportion  progresses  to severe  disease,  manifesting  as 
vasculopathy. It is characterized  by plasma  leakage  and hemorrhagic  diathesis. Plasma  
leakage  may be profound and can result in life -threatening illnesses. More commonly, 
hypotension  is caused  by plasma  leakage.  It may be mild and transient  or progress  to 
profound  shock  with the absence  of pulse and blood  pressure.  The severity  of organ  
involvement  and shock  correlates  with the degree  of vasculopathy.  It usually  becomes  
evident  on the 3rd to 7th day of illness . 
 
Understanding the mechanism, initially, there occurs a transient disturbance in the function  
of the endothelial glycocalyx, which leads to a temporary alteration in the characteristics of  
the fiber matrix  of the endothelium.  Anti-NS1 antibody  acts as autoantibodies  and cross-react 
with platelets and non -infect ed endothelial cells, which triggers intracellular signaling and  
disturbances in capillary permeability. Plasma leakage occurs due to capillary permeability  
and manifests  as a combination  of haemoconcentration,  pleural  effusion,  pericardial  effusion,  
ascites,  and multi-organ  dysfunction.  

10   3.4 Coagulopathy  in Dengue  
The causes  of coagulopathy  in dengue  fever are multifactorial,  and the underlying  mechanism  
remains  unclear.  Primarily,  relatively  consistent  findings  are an increase  in an activated  
Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) and reduced fibrinogen concentrations. Moreover,  
thrombocytopenia  associated  with coagulopathy  increases  the severity  of bleeding.  The 
release of heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate (molecules similar in stru cture to heparin  
that can mimic  its anticoagulation  function)  from the glycocalyx  also leads to coagulopathy.  
 
Abnormality  in coagulation  profile  and causes  of bleeding:  
• APTT ⇑ 
• Fibrinogen  𝖴 
• Platelets  𝖴 
• Disseminated  Intravascular  Coagulation  (DIC) 
• Enhanced  fibrinolytic  activity  
• Release  of heparan  sulfate  or chondroitin  sulfate  from the glycocalyx  
 
3.5 Causes  of thrombocytopenia  
The precise mechanism of thrombocytopenia in dengue fever is not known. Multiple  
mechanisms  contribute  to low platelets  in dengue  fever.  Although  bone marrow  suppression  
is thought  to play a pivotal  role, destruction  of the platelets  too has a significant  role. 
 
Mechanisms  postulated  for thrombocytopenia:  
1. IgM type of anti-platelet  antibody  
2. Anti-platelet  antibodies  + complements  →lysis  of platelets  
3. Dengue  viral-specific  antibodies  
4. Bone marrow  hypocellularity  
5. Destruction  of platelet  in the liver and spleen  (peripheral  sequestration)  
6. Disseminated  Intravascular  Coagulation  (DIC) 
7. Cytoadherance  
8. Platelet  dysfunction  (defect  in ADP release)  
 
In view of COVID  -19, it is important  to know the difference  between  the pathogenesis  of 
dengue  and COVID -19. It is described  and compared  briefly  in the table below  
 
Table  1: Pathogenesis  of Dengue  and COVID -19

• Capillary  leakage  
• Profound  Shock  
• Hemorrhagic  diathesis  SARS-CoV-2 binds to the airway  epithelial  cells,

which  express  ACE2 receptors,  with the help of 
the spike proteins.

and CNS Organ  Involvement:  Lungs,  liver, Kidney,  CNS 
Cytopathy:Thrombocytopenia,  
Leucopenia  Cytopathy  : Thrombocytopenia,  Leucopenia  
Therefore, to summarize, infection by dengue virus causes intense immune activation.  This 
aberrant  immune  activity  leading  to cytokine  overproduction  and generation  of 
autoantibodies  which act against platelets and endothelial cells. A molecular mimicry 
between platelets or  endothelial cells with the NS -1 or pre -M protein of virus may explain 
the cross -reactivity of  anti-NS1 or anti -preM antibody to host cells and also the subsequent 
attack on platelet and  endothelial  cells during  the disease  progression.  Macrophage  
activation  might  be responsible  for the sustained  disease  process  with a high fatality  rate. 
All these  different  mechanisms  ultimately  have a unifying  contribution  which  targets  
vascular  endothelium  leading  to cellular  injury  and contraction  of endothelial  cells which  
results  in increased  permeability  thereby  causing plasma leakage,  which along with 
coagulopathy is responsible for the development  of hemorrhage  and shock.

CLINICAL  MANIFESTATIONS  
OF DENGUE  FEVER  
 
 
 
An individual  infected  with the dengue  virus may be asymptomatic  or symptomatic.  The clinical  
manifestations  range  from mild fever to severe  bleeding,  shock,  and organ  dysfunction.  The 
disease manifestation depends on factors such as age, nutrition, immune status, presence  
of any co -morbidities, type of strain of the dengue virus and primary or secondary dengue  
infection.  
 
Dengue  fever is a dynamic  illness.  The average  incubation  period  varies  from 4 to 6 days 
(ranging  from 3 to 14 days).  After the incubation  period,  fever with various  non-specific  
constitutional symptoms such as headache, backache and malaise usually appear. Dengue  
infection  usually  evolves  into three clinical  phases  such as: acute  febrile  phase,  critical  phase  
and recovery  (convalescent)  phase.  The clinical  presentations  are dynamic  and change  as the 
disease  progresses.  
 
 4.1 Clinical  phases  of Dengue  
• Clinical  Description  of Dengue:  
The clinical  description  of Dengue  Fever  includes  an acute  febrile  illness  of 2-7 days 
duration  with two or more of the following  manifestations:  
o Headache  
o Retro-orbital  pain 
o Myalgia  
o Arthralgia  
o Rash 
o Haemorrhagic  Manifestations  
o Thrombocytopenia or Leucopenia  
o Warning  signs and symptoms  Chapter  4 

14  Case Definition:  The case definition  is as given below  in Box 1: 
 
Box: 1 
 
Figure  5: Clinical  phases  of dengue  infection  
 
• Febrile  phase:  
This phase is characterized by the sudden rise  of body temperature, which is usually high - 
grade  (≥38.5°C)  and may be biphasic.  This phase  may last for 2-7 days and is associated  with 
headache, flushing, vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, and macular rash. The rash is primarily  
maculopapular  or rubelliform.  It usually  appears  after the 3rd to 4th day of fever and occurs  
over the face, neck, chest,  and abdomen.  It usually  fades away as the fever progresses.  
Probable  Dengue  Fever:  
A case compatible  with clinical  description  (see above)  of dengue  fever during  outbreak.  
 
OR 
Non-ELISA  based  NS 1 antigen/IgM  Positive  
(A positive  test by RDT will be considered  as probable  due to poor sensitivity  and specificity  
of currently  available  RDTs)  
 
Confirmed  Dengue  Fever:  
A case compatible  with the clinical  description  (see above)  of Dengue  Fever  with at least 
one of the following  
• Isolation  of dengue  virus (Virus  culture  +VE) from serum,  plasma,  leucocytes  
• Demonstration  of IgM antibody  titre by ELISA  positive  in single  serum  sample  
• Demonstration  of dengue  virus antigen  in serum  sample  by NS1-ELISA  
• IgG seroconversion  in paired  sera after 2 weeks  of four-fold increase  of IgG titre 
• Detection  of viral nucleic  acid by polymerase  chain reaction  (PCR)  

15  Bleeding manifestations may be observed in this phase, depending on the severity of  
the disease. Most of the cases may present with skin and mucosal bleeding (including  
gastrointestinal  or vaginal)  and less commonly  with hematemesis,  melena,  heavy  menstrual  
bleeding,  epistaxis,  or hematuria.  Patients  with comorbidities  such as peptic  ulcer disease  or 
on steroids  have a higher  risk for hemorrhagic  manifestations.  
 
Physical examination may reveal facial puffiness, conjunctival congestion, pharyngeal  
erythema,  lymphadenopathy,  and hepatomegaly.  It is also essential  to look for petechiae  (on 
the skin and palate)  and bruising  (particularly  at venipuncture  sites) and perform  a tourniquet  
test. 
 
• Critical  phase  (leakage  phase)  
 
From the febrile  phase  5- 10 % of the patients  may progress  to the critical  phase  and commonly  
observed  in patients  who have a history  of previous  dengue  infection  (secondary  infection).  
This may also occur  after primary  infection  in patients  with comorbidities  and active  co- 
infections. This phase usually begins after 3rd or 4th day of fever and may last about  24 to 
48 hours.  This phase  is characterized  by vasculopathy  and coagulopathy,  leading  to plasma  
leakage,  excessive  haemoconcentration,  bleeding,  eventually  leading  to shock  and organ  
dysfunction.  The clinicians  need to be carefully  in recognizing  and observing  the warning  
signs of critical  phase  at the early stage mentioned  in Box no 2. 
 
Box: 2 
 
Hemorrhagic  manifestations  may be sometimes  observed  both in the febrile  and critical  
phases.  Radiological  imaging  modalities  such as ultrasonography  (of the chest and abdomen)  
and chest radiographs  are helpful  in the detection  of plasma  leakage.  Early detection  of 
shock  is vital for better  prognosis  and various  parameters  to determine  compensated  and 
decompensated  shock  are shown  in the table-2. Warning  symptoms  and signs 
• Persistent  vomiting  
• Abdominal  pain and tenderness  
• Lethargy  and/or  restlessness,  sudden  behavioral  changes  
• Bleeding  manifestations  like epistaxis,  melena,  haematemesis,  excessive  menstrual  
bleeding,  and haematuria  
• Syncope  or giddiness  
• Clinical  fluid accumulation  (ascites  and pleural  effusion)  
• Enlarged  Liver(>2cm)  
• Laboratory:  Progressive  increase  in haematocrit  with a rapid decrease  in platelet  count

• Convalescent  phase  (Recovery  phase)  
 
With the timing  and optimal  management  during  critical  phase  patients  start recovering  
and passes  through  the recovery  phase.  Majority  of the patients  from febrile  phase  also pass 
through this recovery phase for the complete cure.In this recovery phase the extracellular  
fluid loss owing  to capillary  leakage  returns  to the circulatory  system  during  the recovery  
phase,  and signs and symptoms  improve.  This phase  occurs  after the critical  phase  and lasts 
2-3 days. The patient  develops  a convalescent  rash characterized  by confluent  erythematous  
eruption with sparing areas of normal skin. It is often pruritic. Patients with severe shock,  
organ  involvement  or other issues  that may require  specific  therapy  can expect  a longer  
recovery time. If fluid replacement is not carefully optimized, the patient may develop  
pulmonary  edema  as a result  of fluid excess.  

17  After knowing the clinical phases, it’s essential to know the approach to diagnosing dengue  
patients. A flow diagram depicting the history, investigations, and classification of deng ue 
cases  is shown  below.

Figure  8: Clinical  case classification  of dengue:  
 
 Ask the patient to lie down for 5 mins, measure blood pressure and pulse rate.  
Thereafter  ask the patient  to stand  and repeat  blood  pressure  and pulse rate after 3 
mins of standing.  
 A drop in Systolic  BP of ≥20mmHg  and diastolic  of ≥10 mmHg  indicates  postural  
hypotension  
 The tourniquet  test is performed  by inflating  a blood  pressure  cuff to a point mid-way 
between  the systolic  and diastolic  pressures  for five minutes.  
 A test is considered  positive  when 10 or more petechiae  per 2.5sq.cm  area (1 inch) are 
observed.  
 In severe  dengue,  the test usually  gives a definite  positive  result  (i.e.>20  petechiae).  
 The test may be negative  or mildly  positive  during  the phase  of profound  shock.  


20   4.2 Dengue  without  warning  signs (Mild dengue/Group  A) 
Mild dengue patient usually presents with fever and other symptoms like nausea, 
vomiting, rash, headache, myalgia , arthralgia  and retroorbital pain, etc. Here, the 
complete blood count may reveal leucopenia but usually platelet count and hematocrit 
are in normal range. The other common symptoms which are often encountered are 
anorexia, altered taste sensation, constipation, coli cky pain and abdominal tenderness. 
Mild dengue is subdivided as A1 and A2. The A1 involves patients with fever with 
other non -specific symptoms but no warning signs and A2 involves patients with prior 
comorbidities and other high -risk factors presenting wi th fever and other non -specific 
symptoms without warning signs.  
 
4.3 Dengue  with warning  signs and/or  Risk factors  (Moderate  dengue/  
Group  B) 
Here the patient present with fever with warning symptoms and signs (Refer Box 2). This  
usually  occurs  near the end of febrile  phase  and preferably  at defervescense.  Moderate  
dengue  is further  subdivided  as B1 and B2. The B1 involves  patients  with fever with other non- 
specific symptoms and warning signs whereas B2 involves patients with prior comorbidities  
and other high-risk factors . 
 
4.4  Severe  dengue  (Group  C) 
These patients are those who have progressed from mild or moderate dengue to 
develop symptoms and signs of shock, plasma leakage, and organ dysfunction. Severe 
dengue involves patients presenting with history of fever with shock, patients with 
severe bleeding, patients presenting with severe organ involvement, and metabolic 
disorders (severe acidosis).  
 
Manifestations  of severe  dengue  
1. Severe  plasma  leakage  leading  to: 
• Shock  
• Fluid accumulation  with respiratory  distress  
2. Severe  bleeding  (as evaluated  by the treating  team)  
3. Severe  organ  dysfunction  
4. Aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  or alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  ≥1000  units/L  
5. Impaired  consciousness (GCS  < 9)

DENGUE  FEVER  IN CHILDREN  
Dengue infection in children is slightly different from older age group. Infants and children  
below  10 years  with malnutrition  are high risk group  for severe  dengue  disease  and the 
course can be unpredictable. Some salient features of dengue in children are discussed in  
this chapter  
 
5.1 Clinical Manifestations  
Dengue fever displays  a broad  range  of clinical  manifestations  often with unpredictable  
clinical  evolution and outcome. Most infections  are subclinical.  Infants  and young  children  
may present  with an undifferentiated febrile illness. The classic presentation  of dengue  
fever is usually  seen in older children, adolescents and adults and can be described under 
three phases; febril e, critical and recovery phases.  
 
1. Febrile  phase : It is characterized  by sudden  onset of high-grade  fever that may last for 
2– 7 days. There  may be facial flushing,  skin erythema  (scarlatiniform  or maculopapular  
skin rash), generalized body aches, myalgias,  arthralgias, headache, pain in eyes,  
back ache, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. Occasionally the patient may have a sore  
throat, congested pharynx and conjunctival congestion. Relative bradycardia and  
electrocardiographic changes may be seen in older child ren. A positive tourniquet test  
and minor  hemorrhagic  manifestations;  petechiae  and mucosal  bleeding  (e.g. nose and 
gums)  may be seen in some patients.  Liver may be enlarged  and tender  after 2-5 days 
and indicate an increased risk for development of severe  illness. There is progressive  
decrease  in total white cell count  and platelet  count 
 
2. Critical phase: This phase is seen in some patients, between 3 -7 days of onset of  
fever when defervescence sets in. The child may develop bleeding manifestations and  
shock  with fall in platelet  count  and increase  in packed  cell volume  (PCV).  Bleeding  
manifestations  include  mucosal  bleed like hematemesis,  malena,  bleeding  per vaginum  
in adolescent girls and occasionally muscle hematoma. During defervescence, the  
patient  develops features of capillary leakage in the form of puffiness, edema, ascites  
and pleural effusion especially on the right side. The profound leakage of plasma from  
capillaries  may lead to hypovolemia  resulting  in shock -related  symptoms  in the form of 
restlessness,  cold and clammy  extremities,  rapid thready  pulse,  low blood  pressure  with 
narrow  pulse pressure  (< 20 mm Hg), poor tissue  perfusion  (delayed  capillary  refill time) 
and oliguria.  Some  children  may develop  organ  dysfunction  such as acute  kidney  injury,  Chapter  5 

24  severe  hepatitis,  encephalitis  or myocarditis  and/or  severe  bleeding  without  any obvious  
plasma  leakage  or shock.  Immunocompromised  hosts may have more liver dysfunction,  
delayed  recovery  of platelets  and possibly  more plasma  leak requiring  higher  fluid. 
 
3. Recovery phase: After 24 -48 hours of the critical phase, a gradual reabsorption of  
extravagated  fluid takes place over 48-72 hours.  General  well-being  improves,  appetite  
returns,  gastro -intestinal  symptoms  resolve.  The hemodynamic  status  stabilizes  and 
diuresis  ensues.  During  recovery,  patients  may demonstrate  marked  erythema  with 
extreme  itching  of the extremities,  palms  and soles.  Some  patients  may have a skin rash 
suggestive  of “isles of white in a sea of red”. Due to reabsorption  of extravagated  plasma  
back into the vascular compartment, some children may develop respiratory distress  
due to pulmonary edema. The hematocrit stabilizes or may become lower due to the  
dilution.  The total leukocyte  count  rises initially  in few days followed  by a gradual  rise in 
platelet  count.  
 
5.2 Differential diagnosis  
Various  infections  commonly  seen in children  in different  age groups  may mimic  dengue.  
Therefore  differential  diagnosis  for dengue  infection  includes  influenza,  malaria,  enteric  fever,  
leptospirosis, viral hepatitis, COVID 19 and less commonly meningococcemia and rickettsial  
infections.  Common  infections  like malaria,  leptospirosis,  flu and enteric  fever may also occur 
with dengue.  Several  other viruses  known  to cause  severe hemorrhagic  fever like Ebola  viruses  
and Marburg  viruses  have not been reported  from India as yet. Two other hemorrhagic  fever 
viruses  Hanta  virus and Crimean  Congo  hemorrhagic  virus have been reported  recently  in India 
which  mimic  severe  dengue.  Wide spread  chikungunya  virus infections  have occurred  in various  
parts of India and South -East Asia. Its clinical  manifestations  are similar  to dengue.  However,  
fever is of shorter  duration,  thrombocytopenia  and bleeding  manifestations  are less common.  
Other  clinical  features  that are more common  in chikungunya  include  skin eruptions,  mucosal  
lesions,  polyarthralgia  and encephalopathy.  Since dengue  as well as chikungunya  infections  
are endemic in most part of India, both infections may occur together. Zika, ‘t he emerging’  
flavivirus infection closely resembles dengue. Differentiating features between dengue and  
zika include  shorter  duration  of fever,  pronounced  conjunctivitis/cervical  adenopathy  and 
lesser thrombocytopenia; bleeding manifestations and shock almost never occur. There is  
cross reactivity  between  the IgM ELISA  antibodies  of both dengue  and Zika and hence  PCR/ 
other specific  antibody  techniques  are required  for differentiation  between  the two infections.  

25  5.3 Laboratory investigations  
It is similar  to that in older age group  (Refer  to chapter  on diagnosis).  
 
5.4 Management  
 5.4.1  Mild Dengue  
 
Dengue fever without warning signs . Children with fever, bodyache, rashes or minor  
bleeding may be treated symptomatically. Fever and body ache are best treated with  
paracetamol  (10-15 mg/kg/dose  4-6 times  per day). Salicylates  and other non-steroidal  
anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided as these may predispose the child to  
develop mucosal bleeds. Child should be encou raged to drink plenty of fluids. There is no  
specific antiviral therapy. All patients need regular monitoring by a primary care physician  
for early detection  of severe  disease.  The primary  care physician/  health  care worker  should  
monitor  the patient  for warning  signs along  with hematocrit  and platelet  counts.  Any patient  
who develops  warning  signs as mentioned  in Box 2 should  be admitted  to a hospital.  
 
 5.4.2  Moderate  Dengue  
 
Dengue  with warning  signs.Children  with suspected  dengue  infection  who has any of the 
following  features  should  be admitted  to the hospital.  
 
• Abdominal  pain or tenderness  specifically  right hypochondrium  
• Persistent  vomiting  
• Fluid accumulation  in pleural  cavity,  abdomen  or subcutaneous  tissues  
• Mucosal  bleeds  
• Lethargy,  restlessness  or irritability,  Liver enlargement  >2 cm. 
• Progressive  increase  in hematocrit  with concurrent  decrease  in platelet  count.  
 
These  patients  should  be admitted  in the hospital  and should  be evaluated  for oral intake,  
dehydration.  If oral intake  is poor and child is dehydrated,  intravenous  fluids should  be given 
at a rate of 5-10 ml/kg  over one hour. Crystalloids  (Normal  saline)  are the preferred  fluids.  Vital 
signs and hematocrit  are to be reassessed.  After one hour, if hematocrit  has decreased  and 
vital parameters are improving, fluid infusion rate should be reduced to 3 -5 ml/kg/hour for  
subsequent  24-48 hours  with frequent  monitoring  of hematocrit  and vital parameters.  When  
the patient  is stable  as indicated  by normal  blood  pressure,  good oral intake  and urine output  
with stable  hematocrit,  the child can be discharged.  
 
If after one hour, hematocrit is rising and vital parameters do not show improvement,  
fluid infusion  rate may be continued  at 7- 10 ml/kg  over next 1-2 hour. In case of no further  
improvement,  severe  dengue  disease  needs  strong  consideration  and managed  accordingly.  

26   5.4.3  Severe  dengue  
 
The management  of severe  dengue  infection  demands  high levels  of expertise  and skills for 
administration  of fluids and electrolytes  to correct  hypovolemia  due to leakage  of serum  from 
capillaries  into the extravascular  compartment.  
 
Children  presenting  or developing  any of the following  complications  are diagnosed  to have 
severe  dengue  infection.  
 
• Severe  plasma  leakage  leading  to 
• Shock,  delayed  capillary  refill or oliguria  
• Fluid accumulation  in serosal  cavities  with respiratory  distress  
• Severe  bleeding  manifestations  
• Severe  organ  involvement  
• Liver:  Hepatomegaly, liver failure, AST  or ALT >1000 units  
• CNS: Impaired  consciousness  
• Heart:  Myocardial  dysfunction  
 
Children  classified  as severe  dengue  should  be hospitalized  (preferably  in PICU)  and treated  
with judicious  IV fluid administration  under  Central  venous  pressure  monitoring  ( central  line 
or IVC compressibility by USG), Cardiac contractility (Echocardiography) ,and arterial blood  
pressure  monitoring  (non invasive,  and or invasive:  arterial  line). In case of refractory  
shock  with severe  plasma  leakage,  colloid  infusion  may be given after 2-3 bolus of normal  
saline  (15- 20 ml each). For cardiogenic or septic shock, Vassopressor (Noradrenaline  and 
adrenaline  infusion  may be started).Blood  transfusion  should  be considered  in the presence  
of occult  or overt blood  loss. In addition  to fluid management,  these sick children  may need 
oxygen  and ventilatory support. These children need close monitoring for various 
complications which  should  be identified  early and managed  effectively.  
 
5.5 Bleeding manifestations  
Platelet  counts  are unreliable  to predict  bleeding.  In a small study in which  children  with severe  
thrombocytopenia  were included,  platelet  infusion  did not alter the outcome  of patients.  
In a recent RCT in adults with confirmed dengue infection and thrombocytopenia (≤20 000  
platelets per μL), without persisten t mild bleeding or any severe bleeding, prophylactic  
platelet  transfusion  was not superior  to supportive  care in preventing  bleeding;  on the other 
hand,  administration  of platelets  was however  associated  with adverse  events  some of which  
were serious  adverse  events.  
 
(a) Petechial  spots or mild mucosal  bleed but hemodynamically  stable.  These patients  need 
supportive care including bed rest, maintenance of hydration and monitoring.  IM 
injections  should  be avoided.  Procedures  predisposing  to mucosal  trauma  should  be 
avoided.  If indicated  NG tube should  be inserted  with great care. 

27  (b) Severe bleeding, hemodynamic instability and excessive mucosal bleeds. These patients  
should be treated with blood transfusion and periodic monitoring. When massi ve 
bleeding cannot be managed with fresh blood/fresh -packed cells FFP and PRP may be  
considered.Platelet transfusion  and FFP transfusion may be given when platelet count  
is low (below  50 000/cumm)  with deranged  PT, APTT , hypofibrinogenemia  and increased  
D- dimer  or FDP . 
 
5.6 Fluid overload  
The causes  of fluid overload  in dengue  infection  include  excessive  and/or  too rapid infusion  
of intravenous  fluids;  incorrect  use of hypotonic  rather  than isotonic  crystalloid  solutions;  
inappropriate use of large volumes of intravenous fluids in patients with unrecognized  
severe  bleeding;  inappropriate  transfusion  of fresh-frozen  plasma,  platelet  concentrates  and 
cryoprecipitates; continuation of intravenous fluids after plasma leakage has resolved (24 - 
48 hours after defervescence) and co -morbid conditions such as congenital heart disease,  
chronic  lung and renal disease.  Fluid overload  may also occur in patients  with significant  fluid 
leak. During  recovery  the leaked  out fluid will return  back to the vascular  compartment  and 
may cause  volume  overload.  
 
Fluid overload  can be prevented  by discontinuing  IV fluids in following  situations.  
 
• Cessation  of signs of plasma  leakage  as suggested  by stable  blood  pressure,  pulse volume  
and peripheral perfusion; and decrease  in hematocrit in the presence of a good pulse  
volume.  
• Afebrile  for more than 24-48 hours  (without  the use of antipyretics).  
• Resolving  bowel/abdominal symptoms.  
• Improving  urine output.  
 
(a) Fluid overload with stable hemodynamic status and the patient is out of the critical  
phase  (more  than 24-48 hours  of defervescence):  In such patients  intravenous  fluids 
should  be stopped  but close monitoring  needs  to be continued.  If necessary,  oral or 
intravenous  furosemide  0.1–0.5 mg/kg/dose  once or twice daily, or a continuous  infusion  
of furosemide  0.1 mg/kg/hour  may be given.  Serum  potassium  should  be monitored  and 
any hypokalemia  should  be corrected.  
 
(a) Fluid  overload  with stable  hemodynamic  status  but patient  is still in a critical  phase : 
The intravenous  fluids should  be reduced  gradually.  Diuretics  during  the plasma  leakage  
phase  should  be avoided  because  these  may lead to intravascular  volume  depletion.  
Patients  those  who remain  in shock  with low or normal  hematocrit  levels  but show 
signs of fluid overload may have occult hemorrhage.  Further infusion of large volumes  
of intravenous fluids alone will lead to a poor outcome. Careful fresh blood transfusion  
should  be preferred  as soon as possible.  If the patient  remains  in shock  and the hematocrit  
is elevated,  repeated  small boluses  of a colloid  solution  may be administered.  

28  5.7 Other supportive measures  
Renal replacement therapy: Renal failure is best managed with veno -venous hemodialysis.  
Children with shock, needing multiple vasoactive drugs, with acute kidney injury may need  
continuous  renal replacement  therapy  (CRRT).  
 
Vasopressor  and inotropic  therapies:  These  are indicated  if there is no improvement  in blood 
pressure with adequate fluid replacement despite normal or raised CVP. Commonly used  
drugs  include  dopamine,  epinephrine,  and dobutamine.  These  drugs  should  be administered  
using a central  line and the child should  be managed  preferably  in an ICU. 
 
Standard  treatment  guidelines  should  be followed  for the management  of severe  hepatic  
involvement,  encephalopathy  or encephalitis,  cardiac  conduction  abnormalities  and fluid 
and electrolyte  abnormalities.  
 
There is no therapeutic utility of corticosteroids. Blood transfusion (20 ml/kg) is indicated  
when shock persists despite declin ing hematocrit values (which are indicative of adequate  
fluid replacement)  due to overt or internal  hemorrhage.  
 
Children  with pleural  effusion/  ascites  should  not routinely  undergo  fluid tapping  as this may 
lead to deterioration  in child’s  condition  and there is risk of bleeding  due to the procedure.  
 
Failure  of a patient  with dengue  to improve  within  the usual time period  should  prompt  
evaluation  for complications  such as superadded  infection  or hemophagocytic  syndrome.  
 
5.8 Monitoring  
In view of the dramatic course of severe dengue, monitoring of the patient is crucial in the  
first few hours  of illness.  Heart  rate, respiratory  rate, blood  pressure  and pulse pressure  
should  be monitored  every  30 minutes  till the patient  is stable,  thereafter  monitoring  should  
be continued every 2 -4 hours as long as the child is in the hospital. In critically ill children,  
central  venous  pressure  and accurate  urine output  with an indwelling  urinary  catheter  should  
be monitored. However, difficulties encountered in monitoring CVP in critically sick children  
are a limiting  factor  for its routine  use. The laboratory  monitoring  includes  serial hematocrit  
measurement.  In monitoring  hematocrit,  one should  bear in mind the possible  effect  of pre- 
existing  anemia,  severe  hemorrhage  and early volume  replacement  therapy.  Presence  of 
pleural effusion on chest X -ray or ultrasound examination or hypoalbuminemia can provide  
supportive  evidences  of plasma  leakage,  the distinguishing  feature  of severe  dengue.  
 
Platelet  counts  and DIC studies  should  be monitored  closely  if there is uncontrolled  bleeding.  
If there is a declining  trend during  critical  phase  platelet  count  may be repeated  6 to 8 
hourly. While deciding about the fluid infusion rate on the basis of hematocrit and clinical  
monitoring,  it must be kept in mind that infusion  rates decrease  rapidly  after the first 6 hours  
of intervention  in most uncomplicated  cases.  Excessive  unmonitored  administration  of fluids 
may lead to fluid overload,  congestive  heart failure  or ARDS.  

29  5.9 Prognosis  
Dengue  fever is mostly  a self-limiting  disease  but the mortality  may increase  in severe  dengue  
cases. Early recognition of shock is of paramount importance as the outcome of the patient  
depends  on it. If shock  is identified  when pulse pressure  starts  getting  narrow  and intravenous  
fluids are administered  at this stage,  the outcome  is excellent.  Recovery  is fast and majority  
of patients  recover  completely  in 24-48 hours  without  any residual  sequelae.  The prognosis  
is grave in patients with prolonged shock and when blood pressure is not recordable.  
Other adverse correlates of outcome which can occur without prolonged shock include  
encephalitis, DIC, myocarditis, fulminant hepatitis and ARDS and may not be modifiable by 
early administration.  

30   
 
 
LABORATORY  DIAGNOSIS  
 
In endemic  areas,  early symptoms  of dengue  fever mimic  many  other prevalent  diseases  such 
as Chikungunya  fever,  Zika virus disease,  malaria,  viral infections,  urinary  tract infection,  
typhoid, leptospirosis etc. Hence, for proper management exclusion of these conditions is  
very crucial.  
 
6.1 Laboratory  diagnosis  tests:  
 6.1.1  ELISA  based  NS1 antigen  tests 
 
Dengue NS1 antigen, a highly conserved glycoprotein, produced in both membrane - 
associated  and secretory  forms,  is abundant  in the serum  of patients  during  the early stages  
of dengue  infection  and has been found  to be useful  as a tool for the diagnosis  of acute  
dengue  infections.  It is a simple  test that is highly  specific  and shows  high sensitivity.  
 
NS1 antigen enables early detection of cases i.e., in the viremic stage, which has  
epidemiological significance for containing the transmission. The dengue virus NS1 ELISA  
antigen assay is commercially available. This assay has been evaluated  for sensitivity and  
specificity. The NS1 assay may also be useful for differential diagnosis between flaviviruses  
because  of the specificity  of the assay.  
 
 6.1.2  IgM-capture  enzyme -linked  immunosorbent  assay  (MAC -ELISA)  
 
MAC-ELISA  has been widely  used in the past few years.  It is a simple  test which  does not require  
any sophisticated  equipment.  It is based  on detecting  the dengue -specific  IgM antibodies  in 
the test serum by capturing them using anti -human IgM that was previously bound to the  
solid phase.  This is followed  by addition  of dengue  antigen,  if the IgM antibody  from the 
patient’s serum is anti -Dengue, it will bind to the Dengue antigen. An enzyme -substrate is  
added  to give a color reaction  for easy detection.  
 
The anti -dengue IgM antibody develop faster than IgG and is usually detectable by day 5  
of the illness.  However,  the rapidity  with which  IgM develops  varies  considerably  among  
patients. Some patients have detectable IgM on day’s two to four after the onset of illness,  
while others may not develop IgM for seven to eight days after the onset. In some primary  
infections,  detectable  IgM may persist  for more than 90 days, but in most patients,  it wanes  
off to undetectable  levels  by 60 days. It is reasonably  certain,  however  that the person  had a Chapter  6 

31  dengue  infection  sometime  in the previous  two to three months.  MAC-ELISA  has become  an 
invaluable  tool for surveillance  of dengue  fever.  In areas where  dengue  is not endemic,  it can 
be used in clinical  surveillance  for viral illness  or for random,  population -based  sero-surveys,  
with the certainty  that any positives  detected  are recent  infections.  It is especially  useful  for 
hospitalized patients, who are generally admitted late in the illness after detectable IgM is  
already  present  in the blood.  
 
6.1.3  Isolation  of Dengue  Virus  
 
Isolation  of most strains  of dengue  virus from clinical  specimens  can be accomplished  in 
majority  of cases  provided  the sample  is taken  in the first five days of illness  and processed  
without  delay.  Specimens  that may be suitable  for virus isolation  include  acute  phase  serum,  
plasma or washed buffy coat from the patient, autopsy tissues from fatal cases, especially  
liver, spleen,  lymph  nodes  and thymus  and mosquitoes  collected  in nature.  Isolation  of virus 
takes 7-10 days, hence  may not be very useful  for starting  the management  of patient  with 
dengue  fever.  
 
6.1.4  PCR (Polymerase  Chain  Reaction)  
 
Molecular  diagnosis  based  on reverse  transcription  (RT-PCR),  such as one-step or nested  RT- 
PCR, nucleic  acid sequence -based  amplification  (NASBA),  or real-time RT-PCR, has gradually  
replaced  the virus isolation  method  as the new standard  for the detection  of dengue  virus in 
acute -phase  serum  samples.  
 
6.1.5  IgG-ELISA  
 
An IgG-ELISA  has been developed  that compares  well to the Hemagglutination -Inhibition  (HI) 
test. This test can also be used to differentiate  primary  and secondary  dengue  infections.  The 
test is simple  and easy to perform  but not considered  as a diagnostic  test as it indicates  past 
infections  only. 
 
6.1.6  Serological  Tests  
 
Besides,  MAC ELISA  and IgG-ELISA,  there are few serological  tests available  for the diagnosis  
of dengue  infection  like hemagglutination -Inhibition  (HI), complement  fixation  (CF) and 
neutralization  test (NT) which  are not commonly  used due to various  technical  problems.  
 
6.1.7  Rapid  Diagnostic  tests 
 
A number  of commercial  Rapid  Diagnostic  Test (RDT)  kits for anti-dengue  IgM/IgG  antibodies  
and NS1 antigen  are commercially  available  at present  which  give the results  within  15 to 25 

32  minutes.  However,  the accuracy  of most of these  tests is not known  since they have not yet 
been properly  validated.  Some  of the RDTs have been independently  evaluated.  The results  
showed a high rate of false positive compared to standard  tests, while others have agreed  
closely with standard tests. The sensitivity and specificity of some RDTs were also found to  
vary from batch  to batch.  Hence,  currently,  the programme  does not recommend  the use of 
RDTs for diagnosis  and guiding  the management  of Dengue  fever cases.  
 
6.2 Collection  of Samples  
Laboratory  diagnosis  of Dengue  depends  on proper  collection,  processing,  storage  and 
shipment  of the specimens.  While  collecting  blood  for serological  studies  from suspected  
cases  all universal  precautions  should  be taken.  
 
While  sending  the samples  for lab confirmation  the day of onset  of fever and day of sample  
collection  should  be mentioned  to guide  the laboratory  for the type of test to be performed  
(NS1 for samples  collected  from day 1 to 5 and IgM after 5 days).  
 
6.3 NCVBDC  (earlier  NVBDCP)  Laboratory  Network  
National  Center  for Vector  Borne  Diseases  Control  (NCVBDC),  Government  of India (GoI) has 
identified a network of laboratories (Sentinel Surveillance Hospitals and Apex Referral  
Laboratories)  for surveillance  of Dengue  fever cases  across  the country  since 2007.  Numbers  
are increasing  yearly  to augment  the free diagnostic  facilities  in all endemic  areas,  which  were 
110 in 2007 and 783 in 2022.  They are linked  with 17 Apex Referral  Laboratories  (ARLs)  with 
advanced diagnostic facilities for backup support. For details, please refer to the NCVBDC  
website  www.ncvbdc.mohfw.gov.in . 
 
These  laboratories  receive  the samples,  diagnose  and regularly  send the report  to districts/  
municipal  health  authorities  to implement  preventive  measures  to interrupt  the transmission.  
Dengue  IgM MAC ELISA  test kits (1 Kit= 96 tests)  are provided  to the identified  laboratories  
through  the National  Institute  of Virology  (NIV),  Pune,  since 2007.  NCVBDC  bears  the cost for 
all testing.  Buffer  stock is also maintained  at NIV, Pune,  to meet any emergency  in case of an 
outbreak  in newer  areas  and to avoid  stock out. 

33   
 
 
MANAGEMENT OF  
DENGUE  FEVER  
 
 
Dengue  fever (DF) is common  in older children,  adolescents,  and adults.  It is generally  an 
acute  febrile illness, and the patient presents with biphasic fever with severe headache, 
myalgias,  arthralgias,  rashes,  leukopenia,  and thrombocytopenia.  Although  DF may be 
benign,  it could be an incapacitating disease with severe headache, myalgia and 
polyarthralgia (break -bone fever), particularly in adults. Occasionall y haemorrhages such as 
gastrointestinal bleeding,  hypermenorrhoea  and massive  epistaxis  may occur.  
 
7.1 Triage  of suspected  dengue  patients  
During dengue outbreak, hospital authorities should organize a fever clinic (AFI) to screen  
and triage  suspected  dengue  patients  and designate  space  and beds for admission.  
 
• Primary  triage  
• Usually  triage  should  be performed  by a person  who is clinically  trained  in diagnosis  and 
identification  of warning  signs in dengue.  
• Moderate  to severe  dengue  patients  should  be referred  directly  to a trained  nurse/medical  
assistant  in emergency  ward.  
• Following  parameters  should  be assessed  : 
• Duration  of fever 
• Presence  of warning  signs 
• High-risk groups  (co-morbidities  and co-infection)  
• Tourniquet  test 
• Vital signs including  temperature,  blood  pressure,  pulse rate, respiratory  rate 
• Peripheral  perfusion  by palpation  of pulse volume,  and colour  of extremities,  and 
capillary  refill time 
 
• Recommendations for  CBC (including haematocrit  and platelet count)  and random  
blood  sugar  (RBS)  
• All patients  with warning  signs 
• All patients  with fever >3 days Chapter  7 

34  7.2 Approach  to clinical  management  
Depending  on the clinical  manifestations,  presence  of warning  signs and other high-risk 
factors,  patients  may be classified  as following - 
• Mild dengue  (A): May be managed  on OPD basis 
• Moderate  dengue  (B): Observation  or admission  for in-hospital  management  
• Severe  dengue  (C): Require  emergency  treatment  and urgent  referral  
 
Management  of Mild dengue  patient  (Group  A) 
 
Both the patients  and their family  members  should  be instructed  regarding  the following  
at the outpatient  department  
1. Educate  about  warning  signs and to report  if they appear  
• Severe  abdominal  pain and persistent  vomiting  
• Red spots patches  on skin 
• Bleeding  from nose and gums 
• Vomiting  blood 
• Black tarry stools  
• Drowsiness  or irritability  
• Pale, cold or clammy  skin 
• Difficulty  in Breathing  
2. Advice  to consume  adequate  oral fluids (ORS/Coconut  juice),  avoid carbonated  drinks  
3. Patient  need to take adequate  bed rest. 
4. Over-hydration  in infants  and young  children  should  be carefully  observed.  
5. Body temperature  should  be kept below  100°F.  If the temperature  goes beyond  100°F,  give 
paracetamol.  Paracetamol  is available  in tablet  form or in syrup  form. The recommended  
dose is 10 mg/kg/dose and should be administered in frequencies of not less than six  
hours.  The maximum  dose for adults  is 4 gm/day.  Avoid  using aspirin  or NSAIDs.  
6. Tepid  sponging  of forehead,  armpits,  and extremities.  A lukewarm  shower  or bath is 
recommended  for adults  in case of high grade  fever not responding  to paracetamol.  
 
Follow -up 
• Patients should be followed -up for close monitoring of progression of the disease from  
mild to moderate  or severe.  
• During  this time, clinical  examination  along  with CBC and hematocrit  should  be advised  
according  to the patient  condition.  
 
 
7.3 Management  of moderate  and severe  dengue  
The critical period of dengue fever refers to the period of plasma leakage which starts  
around  the time from febrile  to afebrile  phase.  Rapid  fall of thrombocyte  count  may indicate  
progression  of severity  of disease.  A rising  haematocrit  of 10% above  baseline  is an 
early objective  indicator  of plasma  leakage.  Intravenous  fluid therapy  should  be started  in 
patients  with poor oral intake  or further  increase  in haematocrit  and those  with warning  signs.  

35  The following  parameters  should  be monitored:  
• General  condition,  appetite,  vomiting,  bleeding  and other warning  signs and symptoms.  
• Peripheral  perfusion  assessment  should  be done as frequently  as indicated  because  it is 
an early indicator  of shock  and is easy and fast to perform.  
• Vital signs such as temperature,  pulse rate, respiratory  rate and blood  pressure  should  be 
checked  at least every  2–4 hours  in non-shock  patients  and every  1-2 hourly  in patients  
with shock.  
• Serial haematocrit should be performed at least every four to six hours in stable cases  
and should be more frequent in unstable patients or those with suspected bleeding. It  
should  be noted  that haematocrit  should  be done before  fluid resuscitation.  If this is not 
possible, then it should be checked after the fluid bolus, but not during the infusion of  
the bolus.  
• Urine output  should  be recorded  at least every  8 to 12 hours  in uncomplicated  cases  
and on an hourly  basis in patients  with profound/prolonged  shock  or those  with fluid 
overload. During this period the amount of urine output should be about 0.5 ml/kg/h  
(this should  be based  on the ideal body weight).  
 
Additional  laboratory  investigations:  
Adult patients  and those  with co-morbidities  or patients  in shock  and/or  those  with 
complications  should  undergo  the following  laboratory  investigations.  
• Random  blood  glucose  
• Blood  gas analysis  including  lactate  
• Serum  electrolytes  (sodium,  potassium  and calcium)  
• Renal  function  tests (urea and creatinine)  
• Liver function  tests (AST,  ALT and bilirubin)  
• Coagulation  profile  
• Chest  radiograph  
• Blood  Group  
• Cardiac  enzymes  (Pro-BNP and Troponin  level)  or ECG if indicated  among  high risk groups  
• Serum  amylase  and ultrasound  abdomen.  
 
 7.3.1  Management  of Moderate  Dengue  patients  (Group  B) 
The dengue  patients  with warning  signs and high-risk groups  are considered  to be as 
moderately  ill. 
 
Clinical  approach  for the management  of moderate  dengue  patients  
• Should  be admitted  for in-hospital  management.  
• Baseline haematocrit (hct) test should be performed before starting fluid therapy if the  
investigation results are available immediately.Hydration should not be delayed due to  
unavailability  of hct. 
• All warning  symptoms  and signs should  be carefully  observed.  
• Blood  glucose  level and other laboratory  tests should  be done.  
• Encourage  oral fluids.  If not tolerated,  start intravenous  fluid therapy  of 0.9% NS or RL. 
• They can be sent home  within  12 to 24 hours  if they show rapid recovery  and are not in 
the critical  period.  

36  Dengue  with warning  signs 
(Systolic  pressure  maintained  with signs of reduced  perfusion),  high Hct (≥ 20% rise from baseline)  • For obese  and overweight  patients,  use ideal body weight  for fluid calculations  
• Adequate  intravenous  fluid volume  may be required  to maintain  good perfusion  and 
urine output  of about  0.5 ml/kg/hour.  
• Isotonic  crystalloid  fluid: 0.9% NS or RL are preferred  
• Give7 -10ml / kg crystalloid  solution  (Hartmannʹs  or 0.9% NSS) in 1 h. 
• Evalua tion of clinical  improvement  should  be done every  hourly  
• If patient conditions improves(BP improved, pulse pressure improved, Hct decreased,  
urine output  improved,  capillary  refilling  time improved  ) fluid reduction  should  be done 
gradually  as 
• 5–7 mL/kg/h  for 2–4 hours 
• 3–5 mL/kg/h  for 2–4 hours 
• 2-4 mL/kg/h  for 2–4 hours 
• Fluid should  be stopped  after 24-48 hours  as per the clinical  status  of the patient  
 
If there  is no clinical  improvement  after IV fluid,  hematocrit  should  be evaluated  
 
• If haematocrit  remains  >45%,  give 2nd bolus (Crystalloid  10mL/kg)  for 1hour.  If there is no 
improvement  after 2nd bolus,  manage  as Group  C. 
• If haematocrit  falls to< 45%, suspect  severe  overt bleed and plan for blood  transfusion.  
Give whole  blood  transfusion  at 10ml/kg  or packed  RBC at 5ml/kg.  
 
Monitoring  of the patient  
 
Temperature,  Pulse,  Respiratory  rate, BP should  be monitored  until patient  is out of critical  
phase:  
• Urine output  6 hourly  
• HCT: before  and after fluid replacement,  then 8 hourly  
• Blood  glucose,  renal profile,  liver profile,  coagulation  profile,  as indicated  
• Maintain  fluid balance  sheet

37  Fluid  therapy  
 
In general,  the fluid allowance  (oral + IV) is about  maintenance  (for one day) + 5% deficit  (oral 
and IV fluid together),  to be administered  over 48 hours.  For example,  in a child weighing  20 
kg, the deficit  of 5% is 50 ml/kg  x 20 = 1000 ml. The maintenance  is 1500 ml for one day (M). 
Hence,  the total of M + 5% is 2500  ml. This volume  is to be administered  over 48 hours  in non- 
shock  patients . The rate of infusion  of this 2500 ml may be as shown  below.

M + 7% deficit  7 120–150 
M + 10% deficit  10 300–500 
The rate of IV replacement  should  be adjusted  according  to the rate of plasma  loss, guided  
by the clinical  condition,  vital signs,  urine output  and haematocrit  levels.

• The fluid volumes  mentioned  are approximations.  
• Normally  changes  should  not be drastic.  Do not jump from R-2 to R-4 since this can 
cause  fluid overload.  Similarly  reduce  fluid volume  from R-4 to R-3, from R-3 to R-2 and 
from R-2 to R-1 in a stepwise  manner.  
 
7.3.2  Management  of Severe  Dengue  patients  (Group  C) 
 
These  patients  are vulnerable  and require  urgent  admission  and management.Severe  dengue  
has following  characteristics  
• Severe  plasma  leakage  leading  to dengue  shock  and/or  fluid accumulation  with 
respiratory  distress  
• Severe  haemorrhages  
• Severe  organ  impairment  (hepatic  damage,  renal impairment,  cardiomyopathy,  
encephalopathy  or encephalitis)  
• Severe metabolic abnormalities  
 
Principles  of management  of severe  dengue:  
 
• All patients  to be stabilised  and referred  for admission  to a hospital  which  has blood  
transfusion  facilities.  
• Judicious  IV fluid resuscitation  is essential  and lifesaving.  
• Prefer  a crystalloid  solution  (0.9%  NS or RL) sufficient  to maintain  an effective  circulation  
during  the period  of plasma  leakage  (usually  for 24–48 hours)  and adjust  fluid as per the 
patient  status  
• It’s advised  to obtain  hematocrit  level before  starting  fluid therapy;  lack of haematocrit  
should  not delay fluid management.  
• Monitor  vital signs every  5-30 min. 
• Use IBW for overweight  and obese  patients  while calculating  fluid rates.  
• Blood  group  of the patient  to be investigated . 

39  • Blood  transfusion  should  be given  to patients  with established  severe  bleeding,  or 
suspected  severe  bleeding  (fall in Hct) with unexplained  hypotension.  
 
Intravenous  fluid therapy  during  the critical  period  
 
• Isotonic  crystalloid  solutions  should  be used throughout  the critical  period  except  in the 
very young  infants  <6 months  of age in whom  0.45%  sodium  chloride  may be used. 
• Hyper -oncotic  colloid  solutions  (osmolarity  of >300  mOsm/l)  such as dextran  40 or 
starch solutions may be used in patients with massive plasma leakage, and those not  
responding  to the maximum  volume  of crystalloid.  Iso-oncotic  colloid  solutions  such as 
plasma  and hemaccel  may not be as effective.  
• The duration  of intravenous  fluid therapy  should  not exceed  24 to 48 hours  for those  with 
shock.  However,  for those  patients  who do not have shock,  the duration  of intravenous  
fluid therapy  may have to be longer  but not more than 60 to 72 hours.  This is because  the 
latter group  of patients  has just entered  the plasma  leakage  period  while shock  patients  
have experienced  a longer  duration  of plasma  leakage  before  intravenous  therapy  has 
begun.  
• Always  check  for the signs of fluid overload.  
• It should  be noted  that restoring  the blood  pressure  is critical  for survival  and if this 
cannot be achieved quickly then the prognosis is extremely grave. Inotropes may be  
used to support  the blood  pressure  at this stage.  
 
Management  of compensated  shock  
 
The action  plan for treating  patients  with compensated  shock  is as shown  in algorithm  below:  
• Start intravenous fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid solutions at 10 -20ml/kg/  
hour over one hour. 
• Reassess  the patient’s  condition  (vital signs,  capillary  refill time, haematocrit,  urine 
output)  
• If the patient’s condition improves, intravenous fluids should be gradually reduced to  
7–10 ml/kg/hr  for 1–2 hours,  then to 5–7 ml/kg/hr  for 1-2 hours,  then to 3–5 ml/kg/hr  for 
2-4 hours,  then 2-3 ml/kg/h  for 2-3 hours  and then further  depending  on haemodynamic  
status,  which  can be maintained  for up to 24–48 hours.  
• If patient  is not clinically  improved  (i.e. shock  persists),  check  the haematocrit  after the 
first bolus. If the haematocrit increases or is still high (>45%), repeat a second bolus  
of crystalloid  solution  at 10ml/kg/hr  for one hour. After this second  bolus,  if there is 
improvement, reduce the rate to 7 –10 ml/ kg/hr for 1 –2 hours, and then continue to  
reduce  as above.  
• If haematocrit decreases compared to the initial reference haematocrit (<40% in  
children  and adult females,  <45%  in adult males),  this indicates  bleeding  and the need 
to cross-match  and transfuse  blood  as soon as possible.  Give whole  blood  transfusion  
at 10ml/kg  or packed  RBC at 5ml/kg.

Management  of Decompensated  shock  
 
Patients with decompensated/hypotensive shock should be managed more vigorously. The  
action  plan for treating  patients  with hypotensive  shock  is as shown  in the algorithm  below : 
 
• Initiate intravenous fluid resuscitation with crystalloid or colloid solution (if available)  
at 20 ml/kg  as a bolus given over 15 minutes  
• If the patient’s  condition  improves,  give a crystalloid/colloid  infusion  of 10 ml/ kg/hr for 
one hour. Then continue  with crystalloid  infusion  and gradually  reduce  to 5–7 ml/kg/hr  
for 1–2 hours,  then to 3–5 ml/kg/hr  for 2–4 hours,  and to 2–3 ml/kg/hr  or less, which  can 
be maintained  for up to 24–48 hours  
• If shock persists, review the haematocrit. If the haematocrit increases or is still high  
(>45%),  repeat  a second  bolus of crystalloid  solution  at 10-20 ml/kg  over 15-30 minutes.  
After this second  bolus,  if there is improvement,  reduce  the rate to 7–10 ml/ kg/hr for 
1–2 hours, and then continue to gradual reduction of fluid as mentioned above. Upto  
three rapid boluses  may be given.  
• If haematocrit  decreases  compared  to the initial reference  haematocrithaematocrit  
(<40%  in children  and adult females,  <45%  in adult males),  this indicates  bleeding  and 
the need to cross-match  and transfuse  blood  as soon as possible.Give  whole  blood  
transfusion  at 10ml/kg  or packed  RBC at 5ml/kg.  
• If the shock  is refractory  
• Use of inotropes  should  be considered.  
• Determine  cardiogenic  shock,  septic  shock  
• Evaluate  metabolic  cause  and organ  dysfunction  
• Evaluate  concomitant  medical conditions  and stabilize  the baseline condition  
• Evaluate  persistent  acidosis  and risk of (hidden)  hemorrhage  and treat accordingly  NO IMPROVEMENT

7.4  Management  of severe  haemorrhage  
• Source  of bleeding  should  be identified  as soon as possible  and efforts  to stop the 
bleeding  to be initiated  immediately.  
• Severe  epistaxis,  for example,  may be controlled  by nasal packing.  Endoscopy  may be 
required to identify internal gastrointestinal bleeding. If blood loss can be quantified,  
it should  be replaced  immediately.  However,  if this cannot  be quantified,  aliquots  of 10 
ml/kg  of fresh whole  blood  or 5 ml/kg  of freshly  packed  red cells should  be transfused.  
• In gastrointestinal  bleeding,  H-2 antagonists  and proton  pump  inhibitors  can be used, 
but there has been no proper  study  to show its efficacy.  
• Recombinant  Factor  7 might  be helpful  in some patients  without  organ  failure,  but it is 
very expensive  and generally  not available.  
7.5  Management  of convalescence  phase  
• Convalescence  can be recognized  by the improvement  in clinical  parameters,  appetite,  
and general  well-being.  
• Haemodynamic  state such as good peripheral  perfusion  and stable  vital signs should  
be observed.  
• Decrease  of HCT to baseline  or below  and dieresis  are usually  observed.  
• Intravenous  fluid should  be discontinued.  
i. In patients  with pleural  or pericardial  effusion  and ascites,  fluid overload  may 
occur and diuretic  therapy  may be necessary  to prevent  pulmonary  oedema.  
ii. Hypokalemia  may be present  due to stress  and diuresis  and should  be corrected  
with potassium -rich fruits or supplements.  Intravenous  fluids  should  be reduced  or discontinued  when  any of the following  signs are pres- 
ent. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• Normal  blood  pressure,  pulse and peripheral  perfusion;  
Decrease  in hematocrit  
Apyrexia  (without  the use of antipyretics)  for more than 24–48 hours;  
Resolving  bowel/abdominal  symptoms;  
Improving  urine output.  
Continuing intravenous fluid therapy beyond the 48 hours of the critical phase  
will put the patient  at risk of pulmonary  oedema  and other complications  such as 
thrombophlebitis.  
• 
• Transfuse  platelet  only if bleeding  is present  
Prophylactic  platelet  transfusion  may be considered  for counts  < 10,000/cumm  
without  bleed and those  who may need emergency  surgery  

43  iii. Bradycardia is commonly found and requires intense monitoring for possible  
rare complications  such as heart block or ventricular  premature  contraction  
(VPC).  
iv. Convalescence  rash is found  in 20%–30% of patients.  
 
Signs  of recovery  
 
i. Stable  pulse,  blood  pressure  and breathing  rate. 
ii. Normal  temperature.  
iii. No evidence  of external  or internal  bleeding.  
iv. Return  of appetite.  
v. No vomiting,  no abdominal  pain. 
vi. Good urinary  output.  
vii. Stable  haematocrit  at baseline  level. 
viii. Convalescent  confluent  petechiae  rash or itching,  especially  on the extremities.  
 
7.6 Management  of complications  
7.6.1  Fluid overload  
Clinical  manifestations:  
• Early signs and symptoms include puffy eyelids, distended abdomen (ascites), mild  
dyspnoea.  
• Late signs and symptoms include all of the above, along with moderate to severe 
respiratory distress, which are also an early sign of interstitial pulmonary oedema.  
Restlessness/agitation  and confusion  are also seen. 
• These patients may require ventilatory support soon. If the intravascular volume is  
inadequate or the blood pressure is unstable, check the ABCS (Acidosis, Bleeding, 
Calcium (Na+& K+), Sugar) and other electrolyte imbalances.  
• In cases with no response to furosemide (no urine obtained), repeated  doses of 
furosemide and doubling of the dose are recommended. If oliguric renal failure is 
established,  renal replacement  therapy  is to be done as soon as possible.  These  
cases  have poor prognosis.  
• Pleural effusion or ascitic fluid aspiration may be indicated and can be life -saving in  
cases  with severe  respiratory  distress  and failure  of other measures.  This has to be 
done with extreme caution because traumatic bleeding is the most serious 
complication and leads to death. Discussions and explanations about the 
complications and the  prognosis  with families  are mandatory  before  performing  this 
procedure.  
 
Management  of fluid overload  
 
• Review  the total intravenous  fluid therapy  and clinical  course,  and check  and correct  
for ABCS ( Acidosis, Bleeding, Calcium (Na+& K+), Sugar) . All hypotonic solutions  
should  be stopped.  

44  • In the early stage of fluid overload,  switch  from crystalloid  to colloid  solutions  as bolus 
fluids.  Dextran 40 is effective as 10 ml/kg bolus infusions, but the dose is  restricted  
to 30 ml/kg/day  because  of its renal effects.  Dextran  40 is excreted  in the urine and 
will affect  urine osmolarity.  Patients  may experience  “sticky”  urine because  of 
the hyperoncotic  nature  of Dextran  40 molecules  (osmolarity  about  twice that of 
plasma).  Fluid may be effective  (osmolarity  = 308 mosmole)  and the upper  limit is 
50ml/kg/day.  However, no studies have been done to prove its effectiveness in 
cases of profound  shock.  
• In the late stage of fluid overload  or those  with frank pulmonary  oedema,  furosemide  
may be administered  if the patient  has stable  vital signs.  If they are in shock,  together  
with fluid overload 10 ml/kg/h of colloid (dextran) should be given. When the blood  
pressure  is stable,  usually  within  10 to 30 minutes  of infusion,  administer  IV 1 mg/kg/  
dose of furosemide  and continue  with dextran  infusion  until completion.  Intravenous  
fluid should  be reduced  to as low as 1 ml/kg/h  until discontinuation  when haematocrit  
decreases  to baseline  or below  (with clinical  improvement).  
• These  patients  should  have a urinary  bladder  catheter  to monitor  hourly  urine output.  
• Furosemide  should  be administered  during  dextran  infusion  because  the hyperoncotic  
nature  of dextran  will maintain  the intravascular  volume  while furosemide  depletes  in 
the intravascular  compartment.  
• After administration  of furosemide,  the vital signs should  be monitored  every  15 
minutes  for one hour to note its effects.  
• If there is no urine output  in response  to furosemide,  check  the intravascular  volume  
status  (CVP or lactate).  
 
 7.6.2  Encephalopathy  
 
Severe dengue patients sometimes present with manifestations of central nervous system  
(CNS)  involvement,  such as convulsion  and/or  coma.  
 
Most of the patients with encephalopathy report hepatic encephalopathy. The principal  
treatment  of hepatic  encephalopathy  is to prevent  the increase  of intracranial  pressure  (ICP).  
Radiological imaging of the brain (CT scan or MRI) is recommended if available to rule out  
intracranial  haemorrhage.  The following  are recommendations  for supportive  therapy  for 
this condition:  
• Maintain adequate airway oxygenation with oxygen therapy. Prevent/reduce ICP by  
the following  measures:  
• Give minimal  IV fluid to maintain  adequate  intravascular  volume;  ideally  the 
total IV fluid should  not be >80%  fluid maintenance.  
• Switch  to colloidal  solution  earlier  if haematocrit  continues  to rise and a large 
volume  of IV is needed  in cases  with severe  plasma  leakage.  
• Administer  a diuretic  if indicated  in cases  with signs and symptoms  of fluid 
overload.  
• Positioning  of the patient  must be with the head end up by 30 degrees.  
• Earlyendotrracheal  intubation  should  be considered  to avoid hypercarbia  and 
protect  the airway.  

45  • May consider  steroid  to reduce  ICP and dexamethasone  0.15 mg/kg/dose  IV to 
be administered  every  6–8 hours.  
• Decrease  ammonia  production  by the following  measures:  
• Give lactulose  5–10 ml every  six hours  for induction  of osmotic  diarrhoea.  
• Local antibiotic  gets rid of bowel  flora; it is not necessary  if systemic  antibiotics  
are given.  
• Maintain  blood  sugar  level at 80-100 mg/dl.  In the hospital  and are started  at a rate of 
5-10 ml/kg  over one hour. Recommended  glucose  infusion  rate is between  4–6 mg/kg/  
hour. 
• Correct acid-base and electrolyte  imbalance,  e.g. correct  hypo/hypernatremia,  hypo/  
hyperkalemia,  hypocalcemia  and acidosis.  
• Vitamin K1 IV administration;  3 mg for <1-year-old, 5 mg for <5-year-old and 10 mg for 
> 5-year-old and adult patients.  
• Anticonvulsants should be given for control of seizures:  phenobarbital, dilantin and  
diazepam  IV as indicated.  
• Transfuse blood, preferably freshly packed red cells, as indicated. Other blood  
components  such as as platelets  and fresh frozen  plasma  may not be given because  
the fluid overload  may cause  increased  ICP. 
• Empiric antibiotic  therapy  may be indicated  if there are suspected  superimposed  
bacterial  infections.  
• H2-blockers or proton pump inhibitor may be given to alleviate gastrointestinal  
bleeding.  
• Avoid unnecessary  drugs  because  most drugs  have to be metabolized  by the liver. 
• Consider plasmapheresis  or haemodialysis  or renal replacement  therapy  in cases  
with clinical  deterioration.

SPECIAL  CONDITIONS  
IN DENGUE  FEVER  
 
 
 
 
 
8.1  Management  of Dengue  in High-risk groups  (Co-morbidities  and 
Co- infections)  
Various conditions like pregnancy, pediatric age group, hypertension, diabetes, thyroid  
diseases,  hepatitis,  heart diseases  and renal diseases  are considered  as risk factors  of severe  
manifestations  in dengue.  
 
  8.1.1  Management  of dengue  in pregnancy  
 
Dengue  infection  in pregnancy  carries  the risk of severe  bleeding,  fetal complications,  low birth 
weight  and premature  birth. Risk of vertical  transmission  of infection  from mother  to child is 
high if the mother  is having  severe  viremia  during  around  the time of labor.  As pregnancy  is 
a hypervolumic  state,  pleural  effusion,  ascites,  hypotension  may manifest  easily  among  them 
when infected with dengue. Strict vital monitoring, frequent platelet count and coagulation  
profile  testing  should  be done.  Fulminant  hepatic  failure,  ARDS  and Acute  Renal  failure  in 
pregnancy may be associated with dengue infection. Fluid overload due to management in  
dengue  may occur and may lead to pulmonary  edema.  Thus management  of pregnant  female’s  
infection  with dengue  should  be done carefully  to reduce  morbidity  and mortality  in mother  as 
well as fetus.  
 
8.1.2   Management  of dengue  in children  
 
a. Management  of neonatal  dengue  
After delivery,  the newborn  may go into shock  which  may be confused  with septic  
shock  or birth trauma. In this case, history  of febrile  illness  during  pregnancy  is 
important  which  may help to diagnose severe dengue with shock among neonates 
and infants. Close  observation, symptomatic and supportive  treatment  are the 
mainstay  of management.  Chapter  8 

47  b. Management  of dengue  in infants  
• Management  of dengue  in infants  without  warning  signs 
Oral rehydration  should  be encouraged  with oral rehydration  solution  (ORS),  
fruit juice and other fluids containing electrolytes and sugar, together with 
breastfeeding or formula feeding. Parents or caregivers should  be instructed  
about  fever control  with antipyretics and tepid sponging. They should be 
advised to bring the infant  back to the nearest hospital  immediately  if the infant  
has any of the warning  signs.  
 
• Management  of dengue  in infants  with warning  signs 
When the infant has dengue with warning signs, he/she should be admitted 
immediately  and intravenous  fluid therapy  should  be initiated.  In the early 
stage,  judicious  volume  replacement  by intravenous  fluid therapy  may modify  
the course  and severity of the illness. Initially isotonic crystalloid solutions such 
as Ringer’s lactate (RL), Ringer’s acetate (RA), or 0.9% saline solution should 
be used. The capillary leak resolves spontaneously after 24 -48 hours in most of 
the patients.  
 
c. Management  of infants  with severe  dengue  
Treatment of shock: Volume replacement in infants with dengue shock is very  
challenging  and it should  be done promptly  during  the period  of defervescence.  Each 
and every  case should  be critically  analyzed  separately.  The child should  be managed  
in PICU.  (for more details,  refer chapter  ‘Dengue  in Children’.  
 
8.1.3   Management  of Dengue  in Co-morbidities  
 
a. Dengue  viral hepatitis  
Some patient may have impairment of liver function due to dengue  viral 
infection.  The AST/ALT level may be very high along with prolongation of 
prothrombin time. Hepatic complication is commonly associated with pre -
existing conditions like chronic viral hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatomegaly. 
Patient may also develop  hepatic  encep halopathy due to acute liver failure. Risk 
of severe GI bleeding is also present which may lead to shock.  Thus these 
patients should be managed carefully with hepatic failure regimen with 
appropriate fluid and blood transfusion. If PT is prolonged intraven ous vitamin 
K1 may be initiated in such conditions.  
 
b. Cardiovascular  involvement  
• Dengue  associated  myocarditis:  
Dengue infection may rarely cause acute myocarditis which also may 
contribute for the development of shock. Cardiac complications may be 
seen in presence of CAD, hypertension, diabetic and valvular heart disease. 
Management of shock with IV fluid in such case is sometime difficult due to 
myocardial dysfunction. Patient may develop pulmonary oedema due to 
improper fluid management.  
 
 
 

48  • Dengue  in coronary artery  diseases  (CAD)  and heart  failure:  
Management  of dengue  in CAD is challenging  as these  patients  are already  on 
antiplatelet  agents  which  may lead to severe  bleeding  unless  stopped.  Cardiac 
ischemia  or electrolyte  disturbances  should  be frequently  reassessed.  Patient  may 
develop congestive or biventricular heart failure and hence fluid management is  
challenging.  Thus,  patients  who are on anti-platelet  or anticoagulant  medications  
should  be carefully  monitored.  The anti-platelets  agent  such as aspirin  and other 
anti-platelet  drugs  may be discontinued  at initial stage when the patient  is having  
platelet  count  less than one lakh or having  minor  or major  bleeding  manifestation  
with evidence  of capillary  leakage.  
 
Chronic  heart failure  is also associated  with high risk of fluid overload  due to plasma  
leakage  in dengue  fever,  thus to avoid further  deterioration  of the patient’s  state,  it’s 
critical  to recognize  early indicators  of fluid overload.  Clinical  characteristics  such as 
periorbital  oedema,  respiratory  discomfort,  lung crepitation,  symptoms  of pleural  
effusion  or ascites,  and elevated  jugular  venous  pressure  should  be recognized.  The 
treatment  options  such as loop diuretics  should  be considered  in patients  with 
clinical  signs of fluid overload  if the patient  in hemodynamically  stable.  
 
c. Diabetes:  
Sometimes diabetic patients may present with severe complication in dengue when  
target organs are involved like diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy,  
vasculopathy,  cardiomyopathy  and hypertension.  Due to dengue  infection  in diabetes,  
hyperglycemia  may occur which  may require  insulin  therapy  for better  management.  
Before starting the treatment, a reference hematocrit level must be determined and  
fluid replacement  should  be done with caution  and under  the supervision  of a doctor  
in hospital.  
 
d. Renal  involvement:  
• Dengue  associated  renal  disease:  
Acute  Tubular  Necrosis  (ATN)  may develop  during  severe  dengue  as a result  of shock  
and may complicate  to acute  kidney  injury  (AKI) if fluid therapy  is not initiated  in 
time. Renal  function  may be reversible,  if shock  is corrected  within  a short span of 
time. If the shock  persists  for long time, patient  may develop  renal complications.  
Urine output  monitoring  is essential  to assess  renal involvement.  Microscopic - 
macroscopic  hematuria  should  be evaluated  along with other investigations  like 
blood  urea, creatinine,  serum  electrolyte,  eGFR,  and bicarbonate.  Fluid intake  
should  be closely  monitored  in case of AKI to avoid fluid overload  and pulmonary  
oedema.  There  is currently  a scarcity  of data on the recovery  of kidney  functions  
in dengue  patients  who have survived  a brief episode  of AKI. In a recent  study,  a 
high prevalence of dengue -induced AKI and its link to a subsequent risk of renal  
impairment  has been observed.  The level of renal recovery  varies  depending  on the 
criteria  utilized,  with the majority  of AKI survivors  attaining  less than 25% of their 
baseline  serum  creatinine.This  data suggests  that dengue  patients  with AKI deserve  
a careful  and long-term medical  follow -up, especially  under  nephrology  care. 
  

49   
• Dengue  in Chronic  Kidney  Disease  
Dengue patients may develop severe dengue in the presence of diabetic  
nephropathy,  hypertensive  nephropathy,  connective  tissue  disorders  and other 
preexisting chronic diseases. A multidisciplinary approach with collaboration  
between  physician  and nephrologist  is needed  to decide  for fluid therapy,  renal 
replacement  therapy  and medications.  
 
e. CNS involvement:  
Altered sensorium may develop in dengue patient due to various conditions like  
shock,  electrolyte  imbalance  (due to persistent  vomiting),  fluid overload  (dilutional  
hyponatremia  or other electrolyte  imbalance),  hypoglycemia,  hepatic  encephalopathy  
and also due to involvement of CNS by den gue virus. Acute encephalopathy or  
encephalitis  may be seen in some patients  with severe  dengue.  Sometimes  it may be 
difficult to clinically exclude cerebral malaria and enteric encephalopathy which may  
also appear  during  same period  (epidemic).  Dengue  serology  (IgM)  in CSF may help to 
confirm  dengue  encephalopathy  or encephalitis.  
 
8.1.4   Management  of DENGUE  with co-infections  
 
In countries  with dengue  as an endemic  disease,  healthcare  providers  not only often face 
challenges  to distinguish  infections  like HIV, TB, malaria,  chikungunya,  enteric  fever and 
Leptospira  from dengue  at the time of initial presentation  but these  infections  may exist in 
dengue  cases.  All these illnesses  exhibit  non-specific  presentations,  including  fever,  headache,  
abdominal pain, malaise, and nausea. They also share common laboratory findings such as  
leukopenia  and thrombocytopenia,  which  creates  a management  dilemma  for healthcare  
workers.  The management  of dengue  is more challenging  and difficult  with co-infections  like 
HIV, TB, Malaria,  Chikungunya,  Enteric  fever and Leptospira  as it may lead to severe  dengue.  
Thus,  a high index of suspicion  will be required  to identify  dengue  co-infections.  
 
 TB: Patients  may develop  breathlessness  and massive  hemoptysis  in Pulmonary  
Tuberculosis.  These  patients  may also develop  moderate  to massive  pleural  effusion  
and ARDS.  If patient  has dengue  in presence  of TB and is on ATT, then should  be closely  
monitored  for further  development  of respiratory/pulmonary  complications  to prevent  
morbidity  and mortality.  
 
 HIV: Dengue  patients  may have severe  complications  like shock,  hemorrhage,  
significant  bleeding  and organ  involvement  among  HIV and AIDS patients.  Outcome  
of dengue infection is poor amongst severely immune compromised patients those  
who have opportunistic infection and very low CD4 count. Multi -organ involvement  
may be common  in dengue  infection  and responsible  for high mortality.  Management  
of dengue  infection  with HIV and AIDS should  be undertaken  with HIV specialist  
consultation.  
 
 Malaria:  Malaria  is also a common  co-infection  in dengue  as it is prevalent  
across  India and transmission  also coincides  during  the same period/season.  
Malaria  should  be excluded in the initial phase only as it has its specific 

50  management. Antimalarial  treatment should be started as soon as possible to 
prevent complication and better  outcome  during  co-infection.  
 Chikungunya : It is also reported  that in some geographical  area both infections  
are prevalent  at the same time. Acute  complications  are sometimes  severe  in dengue  
infection  in presence  of Chikungunya.  In case of predominant  joint involvement  in a 
dengue infection, Chikungunya should be investigated.There is no specific antiviral  
therapy for treatment of chikungunya. The management during the acute phase is  
mainly  supportive,  including  rest, fluids,  and anti-inflammatory  and analgesic  agents  
 
 Enteric  Fever : Water  borne  diseases  like typhoid  fever and gastroenteritis  are 
common  during  monsoon  season  along  with dengue  outbreak.  In the initial phase  of 
dengue  infection,  coinfection  with enteric  fever may lead to serious  complications  and 
can precipitate  severe  dengue.  In strong  suspicion,  blood  culture  for salmonella  typhi 
should  be sent for confirmation  as widal test may not be positive  before  2nd week 
of fever.  Most Salmonella  typhi and Salmonella  paratyphi  isolates  are susceptible  to 
azithromycin  and third-generation  cephalosporins.  
 
 Bacterial  infections:  Few patients  with dengue  cases experience  a secondary  
bacterial  infection  usually  community  acquired  pneumonia  (CAP).  In such cases,  
empirical  antibiotic  therapy  as per local antibiogram  needs  to be considered.  In 
admitted  patients,  if the respiratory  symptoms  and fever persists  for longer  duration,  
hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) should be suspected and should be treated  
accordingly  with the culture  and sensitivity.  
 
 Scrub  Typhus:  Scrub  typhus  and dengue  are two major  causes  of acute  febrile  
illness  and may co-exist together.  Scrub  typhus  usually  presents  with sudden  onset  of 
high-grade  fever,  severe  headache,  apathy,  myalgia  and generalized  lymphadenopathy.  
A maculopapular  rash may appear  first on the trunk and then on the extremities  and 
blenches  within  a few days. The patients  may develop  complications  that include  
interstitial  pneumonia  (30 to 65% of cases),  meningoencephalitis  and myocarditis.  The 
recommended  treatment  of choice  for scrub typhus  is doxycycline.  
 
 Leptospirosis:  Leptospirosis  apart from it presenting  as febrile  illness,  has also 
the tendency to manifest as acute respiratory illness, leading to respiratory distress  
and shock.  In areas where  Leptospirosis  is known  to cause  outbreaks  during  monsoon/  
post monsoon,  the possibility  of coinfection  should  be considered.  The recommended  
treatment  of choice  for Rickettsial  disease  are doxycycline  and azithromycin.  

51   
 
 
 
MANAGEMENT OF DENGUE  
AND COVID -19 CO-INFECTION  
Many of the viral infections  like COVID -19, dengue,  seasonal  influenza,  and chikungunya  might  
present  with almost  similar  symptomatology  of fever,  myalgia,  running  nose, malaise,  etc. at 
least in the initial period  of infection,  thus making  the clinical  diagnosis  difficult.  In countries  with 
dengue  as an endemic  disease,  now healthcare  providers  often face challenges  to distinguish  
COVID -19 from dengue  at the time of initial presentation.  They also share  common  laboratory  
findings such as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which creates a management dilemma  
for healthcare  workers.  Thus,  a high index of suspicion  will be required  to identify  dengue  and 
COVID -19 co-infections.  
 
9.1 Case classification  of co-infection  (COVID -19 & Dengue)  
It is observed  that about  70 – 80% of COVID -19 and dengue  cases are asymptomatic.  So, a large 
portion  of the co-infected  population  may be asymptomatic  for both the diseases.  However,  
the presence  of one infection  could enhance  the symptoms  and severity  of others.  Chapter  9

a. Predominant  Corona  Viral Diseases  (P-CVD) 
b. Predominant  Dengue  Viral Disease  (P-DVD) 
c. Co-dominant  co-infection  (CD-CI) 
 
1. Asymptomatic  Co-infection:  
As we know Dengue  and COVID -19 both reported  to present  70-80% cases as asymptomatic.  
Therefore,  there might  be some proportions  of cases  of Dengue  and COVID -19 coinfections  
which  may be either  asymptomatic  or mild symptomatic.  
 
2a. COVID -19 predominant  (P-CVD):  
A case having  cough,  fever,  shortness  of breath,  having  X-ray changes  and/or  CT changes  
suggestive  of COVID -19 and has signs and symptoms  of mild or moderate  dengue  fever.  
 
2b. Dengue  predominant  (P-DVD):  
A case is presenting  with fever,  headache,  retro-orbital  pain later on manifesting  respiratory  
symptoms  CT and/or  chest X-ray changes  suggestive  of mild or moderate  COVID -19. 
 
2c. Co-dominant  Co-infection  of COVID -19 and Dengue  (CD-CI): 
Concurrent  manifestation  of respiratory  symptoms  cough,  sore throat,  shortness  of breath  and 
typical  dengue  symptoms  such as headache,  retro-orbital  pain and joint pain associated  with 
nausea  vomiting  or pain abdomen.  Both infections  may have severe  manifestations.  
 
Co-infected patients may have dominant dengue, dominant COVID -19 or a codominant  
infection. From the medical literature published so far, the relative incidence of codominant  
variety  seems  to be higher  in symptomatic  coinfected  patients.  
 
For all the above  categories,  a confirmed  case will only be labelled,  if microbiologically  proven  
by RTPCR/CBNAAT/  RAT in case of COVID -19 and by NS1Antigen  or IgM (ELISA  based)  for dengue.  
Among  those  cases  where  clinical  presentation  is suggestive  but testing  is negative,  will come 
under  the probable  category.  
 
Treatment  
Before  initiation  of the treatment,  severity  of co-infection  should  be assessed  by signs,  symptoms  
and investigational  parameters.  The treatment  protocol  is planned  as per the dominancy  and 
severity  of infection  either  dengue,  COVID -19 or both. 
 
In the eventuality of a patient being simultaneously infected with more than one virus (co - 
infection),  the diagnostic  challenge  is further  compo unded.  The following  typical  and specific  
clinical  features  might  help in the categorical  clinical  diagnosis  of a case. The treatment  mainly  
dependent  on severity  or predominant  infection  either  dengue  or COVID -19. 

54  Following  are some  general  measures  to be followed  in case of Dengue  and COVID -19 co- 
infection:  
Strengthening  at the primary  health  care level is the key to manage  dengue  through  early clinical  
diagnosis  and recognition  of warning  signs for the severity  of dengue  (such  as abdominal  pain 
or tenderness,  persistent  vomiting,  clinical  fluid accumulation,  mucosal  bleed,  lethargy  or 
restlessness,  liver enlargement  >2 cm, and increase  in hematocrit).  These  measures  will help 
to prevent  the progression  of illness  to severe  dengue  and deaths,  which  in turn will also help 
to reduce  the number  of patients  that need to be referred  to hospitals,  thus avoiding  saturation  
of these facilities  as well as the intensive  care units.  Mild to moderate  Dengue  and COVID -19 
co-infected  patient  should  be monitored  closely  preferably  at the hospital,  as they may rapidly  
progress  to severe  stage;  therefore,  they should  be referred  to the higher  centre  at the early 
stage  by recognizing  warning  signs.  
 
At the same time, all secondary  and tertiary  level hospitals  should  be prepared  to manage  
severe  dengue  and COVID -19 cases.  Consider  development  and implementation  of protocols  
for clinical  management  of acute  febrile  illness,  based  on a scenario  of co-infection  of arboviral  
diseases,  COVID -19 and other respiratory  viruses  (e.g., influenza).  
 
Specific  therapeutic  options  and their use in cases  with co-infection:  
 
Fluid  Therapy:  Fluid therapy  to be given in co-infection  cases  depends  on the hemodynamic  
status  of patient  and degree  of severity.  One may follow  the fluid chart given above  for clinical  
management  of dengue  fever for most co-infection  cases.  It is only in the presence  of Severe  
Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) with COVID -19 that we need to be careful with aggressive  
fluid administration  as it may lead to worsening  of oxygenation  and in such a scenario  Point 
of care ultrasound  (POCUS)  guided  fluids based  on inferior  vena cava diameter  (IVC) should  
be administered  (where  the point of care facility  is available)  with continuous  monitoring  for 
worsening  oxygenation.  Aggressive  fluid resuscitation  is only recommended  for COVID -19 
patients  in shock  for initial resuscitation.  
 
LMWH:  LMWH  is being  used and has been included  in the guidelines  for the management  of 
moderate  to severe  COVID -19 cases  as it is associated  with increased  thrombosis.  LMWH  is 
indicated  in moderate  to severe  category;  however,  careful  monitoring  is required  by D-dimer  
estimation  and when the platelet  count  falls below  1,00,000/mm3, it may be withheld  based  
on the clinical  condition.  In any case of coinfection  with active  bleeding,  LMWH  needs  to be 
stopped  immediately.  
 
Use of Corticosteroids : Dexamethasone has recently been shown to be effective in severe  
COVID -19 and has been recommended  for the same.  Its course  won’t be affected  much  if 
Dexamethasone  is given  after 5 days of dengue  illness.  Hence,  the use of steroids  can be 
continued  as per COVID -19 management  guidelines.  
 
Tocilizumab:  To be used as per national  management  guidelines  for COVID -19 management.  
Antivirals : To be used as per COVID -19 management  protocol.  
Other  supportive  management  to be continued  as per the current  national  guidelines  of COVID  
19

MANAGEMENT OF DENGUE  
CASES  AT PRIMARY  HEALTH  
CARE  LEVEL  AND REFERRAL  
 
 
 
 
Dengue  was earlier  known  as an urban  disease.  However,  due to man-made,  environmental,  
societal changes and improper water storage practices, the vector Aedes aegypti has also  
invaded  rural areas.  Frequent  movement  of the population  has also helped  in introduction  of 
the virus in rural areas,  leading  to rural spread  of the disease.

NURSING  CARE  IN 
ADMITTED  CASES  
 
 
 
 
Nursing care plays an important role for management of Dengue cases. Patients of dengue  
cases  who are hospitalized  require  intensive  monitoring  of vital parameter  and improvement  
and deterioration  during  fluid management.  
 
A) Basic  nursing  care of Dengue  patients  to hospitals  includes  
• Close  observation  and intensive  monitoring  of vitals including  sensorium,  
maintenance  of input-output  chart 
• Encourage  patients  for oral intake  of fluids in case there is no vomiting  and patient  
is tolerating  oral fluids well. 
• In case of high fever,  administer  paracetamol  tablet/syrup  or as advised  by treating  
doctor.  
• Use of Tourniquet  test to detect  petechial  hemorrhage  and other  bleeding  
manifestations  and immediate  referral  
 
B) Watch  for warning  signs &symptoms  
Presence  of the following  signs and symptoms  require  close monitoring  and management:  
• Oxygen  desaturation  
• Severe  abdominal  pain 
• Excessive  vomiting  
• Respiratory  distress  
• Altered  sensorium  
• Confusion  
• Convulsions  
• Thready  pulse 
• Narrowing  of pulse pressure  less than 20 mmHg  
• Urine output  less than 0.5 ml/kg/h  
• Evidence of thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy  
• Rising  Hct 
• Metabolic  acidosis  
• Derangement  of liver/kidney  function  tests. Chapter  11 

58  C) Management  of common  problems  in dengue  patients:  
• High-grade  fever:  Tepid  sponging,  Tablet  paracetamol  & encourage  intake  of 
plenty  of oral fluids 
• Abdominal pain: Severe abdominal pain may be a warning symptom of severe  
complication,  so remain  vigilant  and inform  the treating  doctor,  estimate  & record  
the amount  if blood  loss is present,  monitor  vitals and inform  the doctor.  
• Plasma  leakage:  Monitor  vitals,  hematocrit  and fluid input/output,  encourage  
oral intake  if possible  and start IV fluid as per instructions  
• Shock  or impending  shock:  Monitor  vitals,  hematocrit,  sensorium  and fluid input/  
output,  start IV fluid/inotropes  as per instructions  
• Decreased  urine output:  First rule out catheter  blockage  by palpating  the bladder.  
Flush the catheter if blocked. Continue monitoring vitals, fluid input/output and  
inform  the doctor.  
• Respiratory  distress:  Check  oxygen  saturation  and administer  oxygen  via face mask 
or nasal catheter  if Sp02 <90%,  Look for pleural  effusion,  cardiac  involvement  and 
inform  the doctor.  
• Convulsions/encephalopathy:  Pay attention  to maintenance  of airway,  breathing  
and circulation (ABC). Be ready with resuscitation set for emergency intubation  
and mechanical  ventilation.  
• Fluid overload can develop during recovery phase of the illness due to fluid  
shifts.  Closely  observe  for pedal oedema,  neck vein engorgement  and respiratory  
distress.  Continue  strict fluid input/output  monitoring  during  the recovery  phase.  
 
D) Providing  Health  education  & motivation  
• Motivational  behavior  change  talks must be given to attendants  of patients  and 
patients  if they are fully conscious.  The contents  should  include:  
• Common breeding sites of Aedes mosquitoes and adoption of strategy of  
search  and destroy  the breeding  sites. 
• Use of personal  protection  measures  against  mosquito  bite 
• Recognition  of dangerous  signs & early health  seeking  behavior

PLATELET  PRODUCTS  
 
 
 
1. Random donor platelets (RDP): the platelets are prepared from whole blood.  
Depending upon the preparation methods they can be classified as PRP Platelets and  
buffy coat reduced  platelets.  Either  of these  platelet  products  have a volume  of 40-50 ml, 
platelet  content  of 5.5x1010 and shelf life of 5 days. These  whole  blood  derived  platelet  
concentrates  are expected  to raise the platelet  count  by 5-7 thousand  in an adult and 20 
thousand  in pediatric  patients.  
 
2. Buffy  coat pooled  platelets  (BCPP):  Pooled  buffy coat platelet  concentrates  are derived  
from four donations  of whole  blood  (Obtained  from the Buffy Coat of ABO identical  
donors re -suspended in plasma or additive solutions). BCPP has a volume of 160 -200 
ml, with platelet  content  of ranging  from 2.5 to 4.4 x 10¹¹ per product.  
 
3. Single  donor  aphaeresis  (SDP):  are collected  by a variety  of aphaeresis  systems,  using 
different  protocols.  A single  donation  procedure  may yield one to three therapeutic  
doses  and the donation  may be split between  two or three bags, depending  on counts.  
SDP prepared  are leukocyte  reduced  however  in some aphaeresis  systems  filtration  may 
be required  for leucocyte  depletion.  For SDP Collection  Donor  are tested  for platelet  
counts,  TTI markers  and blood  group  before  collection.  The average  volume  for SDP 
is 200-300 ml, yield or platelet  content  of 3x1011 per bag and is thus equal  to 5-6 RDP. 
Thus it also often regarded  as the jumbo  pack. SDPs are expected  to increase  a patient’s  
platelets  count  by 30-50000/ul.  BCPP serves  as an alternative  choice  of SDP in case of 
emergency.  
 
a. Compatibility testing not required for platelet concentrates. Although platelet  
concentrates  from donors  of the identical  ABO group  and the patient  can have 
the components of choice and should be used as far as is possible. However,  
administration  of non identical  ABO platelet  transfusions  are also an acceptable  
transfusion  practice  in particular,  when platelet  concentrates  are in short supply.  
 
b. Similarly,  RhD-negative  platelet  concentrates  should  be given,  where  possible,  
to RhD -negative patients, particularly to women who have not reached the  
menopause. If RhD -positive platelets are transfused to RhD -negative woman of  
childbearing  potential,  it is recommended  that anti-D should  be given.  A dose 
of 300 IU of anti-D should  be sufficient  to cover six SDP or 30 RDP RhD - positive  
platelets  within  a 6-week period.  
 
c. Standard  Dose for adults  is 5-6 units of Random  Donor  Platelets  or One unit of 
Aphaeresis  platelets.  For Neonates/  Infants  the dose of the platelets  should  be 10- 
15ml/kg  of body weight.  Annexure
