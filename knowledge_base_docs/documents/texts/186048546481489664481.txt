 Pulse Polio Programme in India  
 
 India committed to  the resolution passed by World Health Assembly for global polio 
eradication in 1988.  
 Country introduced polio vaccine under Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI , 
1978 ), and subsequently in Universal Immunization Programme (UIP , 1985 ), but 
started carrying out special polio campaigns from 1995.  
 At present in routine immunization , bivalent oral polio  vaccine (bOPV) dropsare being 
provided to all children less than five years o f age and Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) to 
children less than one year of age .  
 National Immunization Day s (NID s) commonly known as Pulse Polio Immunization 
programme was launched in India in 1995, and is conducted twice in early part of each 
year.  
 Additionally, multiple rounds (a t least two) of sub - National Immunization Day s(SNID s) 
have been conducted over the years in high risk states/areas.  
o In these campaigns, children in the age group of 0 -5 years are administered polio 
drops.  Over 170 million children are immunized during e ach NID and 77 million 
in SNID.  
 
History of Polio in India  
 Prior to introduction of Polio vaccine i n 1978, there were estimated 2, 00,000 polio 
cases annually.  
 Prior to introduction of Pulse Polio Programme in 1995 there were estimated 50,000 
polio cases an nually.  
 In 1997, case -based polio surveillance started with support from WHO - National Polio 
Surveillance Project (WHO -NPSP). Surveillance for detection of polio virus transmission 
is being done through acute flaccid paralysis (AFP Surveillance) with labor atory 
network since then.  
 Last case of wild virus type 2 in country was reported in 1999 from Aligarh, Northern 
India  
 Inspite coverage of polio rounds being very high, polio virus type 1 &  3 continued to 
circulate. As a result, research was conducted which indicated that monovalent type 1 & 
3 have better sero -conversion than tOPV. Hence, monovalent vaccine type 1 was 
introduced followed by introduction of type 3 vaccine.  

2 
  In 2005, India was the first country to use monovalent vaccine (type 1) globally, after 
country level research.  
 In January 2010, based on country’s research, India was the second country to 
introduce bivalent vaccine, after Afghanistan , which proved to be  very effective . 
Last cases of wild polio virus, by type of virus:  
24th Oct. 1999  last case of wild polio virus type 2 (WPV Type 2) reported from District 
Aligarh, U.P  
22nd Oct. 2010  last case of wild polio virus type 3 (WPV Type 2) reported from District 
Pakur, Jharkhand  
13th Jan. 2011  last case of wild polio virus type 1 (WPV Type 2)  from District 
Howrah, West Bengal  
 
 WHO , on 24th February 2012 , removed India from the list of “endemic countries with 
active polio virus transmission” . 
 On 27th March 2014, the Regional Certification Commission  of World Health 
Organization certified  South -East Asia Region of WHO , which includes India,  as 
polio free .This is a remarkable achievement considering the fact that in 2009 India 
accounted for half of the total number of polio cases globally and there were an 
estimated 2 lakh cases of polio every year in the country in the year 1978.  
 There are 24 lakh vaccinators  and 1.5 lakh supervisors involved in the successful 
implementation of the polio campaigns . 
 The total number of cases and number of affected districts during past 7 years is as 
below:

 Following steps are being taken by the Government to maintain polio free status in India  as risk 
persist on account of ongoing transmission in other countries which may lead to importation of 
polio virus.  
 
 Maintaining community immunity through high quality National and Sub National polio 
rounds each year . 
 
 Polio surveillance across the country for any importation or circulation of poliovirus 
and Vaccine Derived Polio Virus ( VDPV ) is being maintained. Polio surveillance in 
country is considered to be of international standard as indicated by AFP rate (which is 
10.7 8 and 10.61 respectively for 2015 and 2016 against the global minimum 
recommended of 2) and % adequate stool rate (which is 86 and 87 respectively for 
2015 and 2016 against the global minimum recommended of 80%) as on 28th January, 
2017 . 
 
 Environmental surveillance (sewage sampling) have been established to detect 
poliovirus transmission and as a surrogate indicator of the progress as well for any 
programmatic interventions strategically at 35 sites in Mumbai, Delhi, Patna, Kolkata , 
Punjab , Hyderabad , Lucknow  and Gujarat  as on 28th January, 2017 . 
 
 To reduce risk of importation from neighbouring countries, international border 
vaccination is being provided through continuous vaccination teams (CVT) to all eligible 
children round the clock. Th ese are provided through special booths set up at the 
international borders (both Rail and Road routes)  that India shares with Pakistan, 
Banglad esh, Bhutan , Nepal and Myanmar. Nearly 1 crore children have been vaccinated 
till December, 2016 at these border sites.  
 
 Government of India has issued guidelines effective since March 2014, for mandatory 
requirement of polio vaccination to all international travellers for travel between  India 
and other polio affected countries namely Pakistan,  Afghanistan, Nigeria,  Ethiopia, 
Kenya, Somalia , Syria and Cameroon (as per the polio cases reported from these 
countries in year 2014) .Nearly 1.74 lakh doses have been given till December, 2016 to 
such travellers.  
 

4 
  
 All States and Union Territories in the country have developed  a Rapid Response Team 
(RRT) to respond to any polio outbreak in the country. Emergency Preparedness and 
Response Plans (EPRP) has also been developed by all States indicating steps to be 
undertaken in ca se of detection of a polio case.  
 
 A rolling emergenc y stock of OPV is being maintained to respond to 
detection/importation of wild po liovirus (WPV) or emergence of vaccine derived 
poliovirus ( VDPV).  
 
 As part of Polio Endgame Strategy, India  has switched from trivalent Oral Polio Vaccine 
(tOPV) to Bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (bOPV) on 25th April, 2016 both in polio campaigns 
and routine immunization.  The country has been validated free of tOPV after the switch.  
As a risk mitigation measure, country has introduced Inactivated Polio Vaccine across the 
country in all states.
